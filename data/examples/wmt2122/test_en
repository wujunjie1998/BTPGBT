Libya: plan for presidential election on 24 December close to collapse
The chances of Libya staging its first presidential elections on the long planned date of 24 December appeared close to collapse on Sunday after the body overseeing the vote said it was unable to announce the the approved candidates because of continued legal doubts.
With the elections less than a fortnight away and virtually no time for campaigning, a postponement would represent a bitter blow to the international community's hopes of reuniting the deeply divided country.
Foreign powers will also fear the overall momentum towards democracy could dissipate.
In the short term they will have to agree whether or not the interim government continues in order to fill the political vacuum and prevent a return to civil war.
A series of court rulings have overturned the Libyan electoral commission's decisions to block high-profile figures including Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the son of the former dictator, from standing for the presidency.
The interim prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah and warlord Khalifa Haftar, the head of the self-styled Libyan National Army, have meanwhile been approved by the commission but subsequently appealed by other parties.
It said in a statement on Saturday it said could not announce the names of the approved candidates out of the nearly who 100 have applied because it was "keen to exhaust all means of litigation to ensure its decisions comply with issued judgements."
Rival factions have accused each other of intimidating or bribing judicial officials to secure their reinstatement of their candidates, and the commission is looking to see if the decisions were valid.
In the case of Dbeibah, he had pledged as a condition of becoming interim PM that he would not stand for election but has since argued in court that this was a moral pledge with no legal force.
Saif Gaddafi was convicted in absentia in 2015 on war crimes charges for his part in fighting the revolution that toppled his father, Muammar Gaddafi.
He denies wrongdoing.
The presence of tens of thousands of foreign fighters, mercenaries and indigenous militia make the country a tinderbox, and there are fears an election conducted with disputed candidates would only lead to a result that was not recognized.
In a sign of the tensions over foreign forces, France is pressing the EU to agree on Monday to impose sanctions on the Russian private military contractor Wagner Group, which it says operates in Libya and the Sahel.
Moscow denies Wagner is linked to the Russian state and has said it would retaliate against EU sanctions placed on its citizens.
The international community's ability to demand the Libyan political class stick to the 24 December election date, which was first agreed in February, has been hampered by the appointment of a UN special envoy, Ján Kubiš, who resigned three weeks before the elections after less than a year in the post.
The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has since appointed Stephanie Williams, a forceful former UN deputy special envoy, to act as his special adviser.
Russia vetoed her appointment as a full envoy, but she has deep knowledge of Libya and last year displayed a willingness to confront those in the political class opposed to elections.
The UN mission issued a statement urging all sides not to reverse the gains made, pointing to the registration of nearly 3 million voters, the successful distribution of voter cards and the applications of large numbers of candidates for the presidency and parliament as signs of deep popular support for elections.
The US ambassador to Libya, Richard Norland, said "refusing to go to the elections and mobilizing to obstruct will only place the fate and future of the country at the mercy of those inside Libya and their external backers who prefer bullet power over ballot power."
Android hardware Cleaning tip
Thin (0.3mm - 0.5mm) DRY interdental brushes are ideal for clearing those tiny port holes which house your smart device microphones and speakers.
They are a cheap product and safer than many other methods, such as rubbing alcohols, tooth picks, pins, and needles.
I just used this method to clear the microphone port on my Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic as it was not registering my voice when using speech to text functions.
After months of thinking, I would need to arrange a warranty replacement or need to book a repair.
After much frustration shouting at my watch during phone calls so I could be heard and / or understood.
After following manufacturer advice and using the water lock functions, resetting the device AND factory restoring my device.
And after scouring the internet on multiple occasions.
There seemed to be no guaranteed satisfaction.
Then I had a revelation and I tried interdental brushes, and they work...
They work very VERY well!
After a few pokes and twizzles with the thin but firm bristled rod, your device should work just as it did when it was brand new.
* I advise this be done with a dry brush, and will not accept any repercussion if you decide to use it with any combination of any cleaning product.
South Africa Pays Tribute to Last Apartheid Leader De Klerk
South Africa on Sunday paid an official tribute to FW de Klerk, the final president of white rule, who freed Nelson Mandela from prison and steered the country from apartheid to democracy.
De Klerk died on November 11 aged 85 following a battle with cancer.
Four days of national mourning were declared in his honor.
He served as president from 1989 to 1994 and is remembered most for leading South Africa's transition from white-minority rule to the first multi-racial elections in 1994.
De Klerk also shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela in 1993 after freeing him from prison in 1990.
Mandela then became South Africa's first black president after his African National Congress party won the 1994 election.
President Cyril Ramaphosa attended Cape Town's Protestant Groote Kerk - one of South Africa's oldest churches - on Sunday morning to deliver a eulogy in De Klerk's honor.
"He was often misunderstood due to his over-correctness," De Klerk's widow Elita Georgiadis told around 200 attendees.
I shall never forget this man who mesmerized me, who made me want to help him achieve this huge task ahead of him.
A private mass and the national anthem preceded the ceremony, which featured a portrait of De Klerk between two candles and a choir decorated with white flowers.
Despite a positive reputation abroad, De Klerk divided opinion in South Africa and his death prompted mixed reactions.
Critics say he remains inseparable from apartheid-era crimes and could have been held accountable for them had he lived longer.
De Klerk represented the National Party, which in 1948 formally established apartheid's racial segregation and disenfranchisement of South Africa's non-white majority.
Outside the church, a small group of protesters held signs saying, "Justice denied" and "Justice for apartheid victims" and were swiftly led away by police.
The surrounding area was closed to traffic and placed under high security.
Comments in his final years also tarnished De Klerk's image amid criticism for his failure to apologize officially for the crimes of apartheid.
In 2020, he denied apartheid was a crime against humanity before retracting the statement and apologizing.
De Klerk's foundation issued a posthumous video apologizing "for the pain, hurt, indignity and damage that apartheid has done" to South Africa's non-white populations.

Avalanche at Washington state ski resort kills 1, traps 5
An avalanche swept through part of a Washington state ski resort used to access backcountry skiing on Saturday, killing a 60 - year-old man and temporarily trapping five others.
The avalanche was reported about 10: 50 a.m. in the Silver Basin area of Crystal Mountain, which is located about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southeast of Seattle, said Pierce County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Darren Moss.
The identity of the man who died hasn't been released, but authorities say he wasn't breathing after being pulled out of the snow and didn't survive despite CPR efforts by another skier.
The other skiers in his group rescued themselves with the help of two witnesses who saw them get swept up by the snow.
All were wearing avalanche beacons.
While all of those caught in the avalanche were experienced backcountry skiers, a warning had been issued against skiing in the area, which was just inside the boundaries of Crystal Mountain Resort.
The private ski resort determines the conditions but there is nothing that stops skiers from going there because the property abuts public lands in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.
Frank DeBerry, the resort's president and CEO, said all six men held the ski resort's uphill travel passes, which means they were registered with ski patrol, participated in an orientation on how and where to access backcountry skiing through the resort's property and were required to check snow conditions prior to their excursion.
"Skiers can travel at will wherever they want in the national forest.
They had gone out into the forest but ended up back in bounds (of the resort) where this slide occurred, "DeBerry said
In addition to shutting the area where the slide occurred, the resort earlier in the day closed the Mt. Rainier Gondola because of winds reaching 100 miles per hour (161 kilometers per hour).
The avalanche came amid the season's first major snowfall.
The area is under a winter storm warning until Sunday morning, with the National Weather Service saying 12 to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of snow is possible for areas above 2,000 feet (610 meters).
"We've had a late start to the season and now we've gone from virtually no snow to a giant snow storm.
People got excited, "DeBerry said.
"We all have to remember that it's a sport that carries risk."
Crystal Mountain is the largest ski resort in Washington state, encompassing 2,600 acres (1,052 hectares).

I'm still with you
Oh, so glad you asked, I have a lot to say about this.
Yes, there ’s been a pretty drastic change.
I have been overweight / obese since I was 3 years old, so existing like that is all I ever knew until age 30.
The vast majority of my family and friends who knew me before treat me the same and are SO.
damn.
supportive.
I do have a select few familial relationships, which were strained to begin with, where it seems that my weight loss has exacerbated the existing problems.
This could be the result of their complexes or mine, because I think they ’re used to being able to shit on me and I, in turn, am now even less willing to take their shit.
One person in particular has, very weirdly, tried to take credit for my weight loss.
Basically, they ’ve insinuated that they were the driving force that got me here, under the guise of being supportive, when in reality they didn’t even know I was making these changes until I had already gone through with the RNY and lost well over 100lbs.
In fact, they were the last to know, intentionally, because I just didn’t want them to try to take control and bully me into things like I used to let them.
Unsurprisingly, now they ’ve taken to insulting my other features, like telling me my nose and forehead look too big since I lost weight and that I need a nose job and bangs to fix it - this is typical behavior from them.
At first, they just private messaged me these things but when I didn’t respond, they took to commenting about it publicly on social media, with no shame.
When I was bigger, that would have destroyed me and I would have listened but now I just ignore it.
Luckily, my skin is thicker now (not just cause it ’s in excess these days).
The attention from strangers is by far the weirdest part for me.
When I was bigger, people really didn’t pay me any attention.
Like, little to no eye contact.
No saying hello or smiling at me as we pass on the street unless they knew me.
Definitely no going out of their way to help or compliment me.
It was more isolating than I realized because it ’s what I was used to.
I knew people could be judgmental of my size - with many doing so openly - but I never realized, until I lost weight, the micro-level of it and just how subtle it can come about.
Not only was I unaware of it, simply because it ’s what I was used to, but I also don’t think those who perpetuate it are actively aware they ’re doing it.
I really believe it is a subconscious bias, bred and exacerbated by the portrayal and treatment of overweight people in media, that many people just don’t realize they project.
Now, it feels like everyone everywhere looks at me, smiles at me, talks to me, etc.
Both men and women engage with me differently, making more efforts to talk to / get to know me - and that ’s just platonically.
Romantically, my dating pool has expanded from what few were willing to be seen with me to what feels like … everyone lol.
It is DAUNTING.
I assumed that, at the very least, the fact that I was morbidly obese, have lost all this weight and now have excess skin would deter some people, but despite the fact that I put my weight loss and excess skin right at the forefront (because I don’t want it to be a secret), it has bothered / deterred approximately no one in my experience.
It seems to have done the opposite and made them more interested, actually.
Huge shock to me.
I do have to put a little PSA here, though, for men who are newly talking to / dating a woman who has lost weight: comments like “I am so happy you lost the weight, you clearly haven’t realized how gorgeous you are yet ” is NOT the way to go.
I have heard some variation of this more times than I care to count and they all thought it was a compliment.
Hey r / Military!
I am from a country where military duty is mandatory and I am just wondering how's it like for other countries.
Hello everyone!
I am from Estonia, where I am part of the National Defense Force.
Here military service is mandatory for all men from the ages of 16 - 29.
You have to complete either 8 or 11 months of training after which you are sent to the "reserve" unit until you turn 60.
In that time, the Defense Force is eligible to demand you take part in some military exercises once or twice a year for approx 2 weeks per year.
However, you are not mandated to go on a foreign mission.
If you want to do that, you have to join the "scouts battalion" where you will be a professional military dude with pay and such.
I am just wondering how is it for other countries?
If you join the military in, for example, the USA or the UK, then are you mandated to go fight in another country?
What do you guys think about mandatory military service?
During training when I was in Tapa 2018 - 2019, there were also units from the UK, US, France, Belgium, Denmark and Canada.
Unfortunately though, we really didn't have much time to socialize and I didn't get to ask those guys in person what it's like for them to serve in their country's military.
I know that there are probably mostly NATO members in this subreddit, but it would be interesting to hear from other (non-NATO) countries as well.
Sorry for my poor grammar.
English is my second language.
You can also reset it from there.
However I recommend you resetting it from your computer, even if you are logged in on your computer, this is for you to remember your password, as this information is important to know by memory
Once your password is reset from your computer, please try accessing once again on our daughter's e-reader with your new password
please let me know if it works
I enjoy articles like this help untangle the convoluted web of sociopathic megalomaniac men that my dad glorified ad nauseam and the plurality of leaders he decried.
Guess where Nixon and Carter fell, and his golden boy Reagan could do no ills.
While I have long since known that this world view is complete BS and in fact I despise each of those megalomaniacs from Caesar through Bonaparte, Nixon, Reagan, Bush and Trump,
I can appreciate the historical significance of Caesar or Napoleon, but the quasi-sacred nature of their sanitized histories turned me off them later on in life.
To this day, I still refuse to study the history of Poland as that would just allow the paranoid conspiracies of my dad to bubble forward.
Returning to this article, I love the small details that remind you that there actually was one good choice (despite smaller flaws - but mostly acting in good faith) and one side that was not good, did not act in good faith, and where malice was and is the more likely explanation than stupidity.
That's the thing.
Republicans love to hide behind stupidity rather than admit malice, but make no mistake if the ideological basis of a party is being under siege.
Then coincidence, serendipity, etc. rarely exist.
The besieged mentality means that every action must count, or else you are expensing limited energy on frivolous acts.
But Republicans love to hide behind our more nuanced understanding of the world and try to throw back the various philosophical razors.
Thank you for taking the time to chat to me today.
Once this chat has ended you will be sent a 'rate my chat' feedback email.
Please kindly fill this in if you have a moment, however if you don't have time then may I wish you a wonderful day and thank you again.

I went on an install with the owner, and when we came back he parked the empty trailer close to the dumpster.
No reason in particular, there was just space there, so that ’s where he left it.
The next morning I come into work and Jerry (not his real name) comes up to me looking pissed about something.
Nothing new, he was always sort of grumpy old fella.
The conversation went something similar to below (18 years ago, so I don’t remember exactly).
Jerry: Did you park that trailer there by the dumpster?
Me: No, the owner drove yesterday.
Jerry: You can’t park that trailer there, then I can’t get to the dumpster!
Me: I didn’t park it there, the owner did, but I can move it.
Jerry: I don’t know why you would park that trailer there.
You know we need to have access to the dumpster.
Me: but I didn’t park it there.
Why don’t you talk to the owner about it?
Jerry: blah blah blah your fault, damn kids have no respect, blah blah blah
Me: It was not me.
The conversation continued in that manner for several minutes, with him berating me for leaving the trailer in the way that I didn’t leave in the way.
From that day forward, until I left that cabinet shop a couple years later, any time I worked late (which was more often than not) and the 5x8 trailer was at the shop, I ’d pick up the tongue and roll it right up to the dumpster for Jerry to find in the morning.

Family pays tribute to "energetic" 18 - year-old stabbed to death in Birmingham
The family of a teenager who was stabbed to death in Birmingham have described him as a "young, energetic 18 - year-old" who dreamed of being a digital marketing specialist.
Yahya Sharif was found seriously injured in Coventry Road, Small Heath, just before 5.30pm on Friday, West Midlands Police said.
Police were called to the scene by the ambulance service.
Despite the best efforts of paramedics, Yahya, from Nechells, was confirmed dead at the scene.
A post-mortem revealed he died from a stab wound to the chest.
A statement released on behalf of his family said: "We cannot believe that Yahya has disappeared from our eyes.
We still don't know the reason he was killed.
A young, energetic 18 - year-old, his dream was to be a digital marketing specialist.
The whole community are shocked.
May God be with the family he left behind, especially his parents. "
Detectives have been gathering CCTV and other evidence as they try to piece together what happened and identify and trace who stabbed the teenager.
Detective Inspector Hannah Whitehouse, from the homicide unit, said: "Yahya was just 18 and with his life ahead of him.
This has now been taken away in the most tragic of circumstances.
There is no clear motive for the attack and we're working round the clock to identify and trace who was responsible.
We've spoken to a number of witnesses but we still need to hear from anyone with information who can help us.
I'd appeal for those who were there at the time to do the right thing, come and speak to us and tell us exactly what happened and why.
It's the least Yahya's family deserve. "
Anyone with any information should call 101, quoting reference number 3643 10 / 12 / 21.
An Alamo location in California pulled a similar scam on me.
When I returned the car, the agent found scratches under the car (which I did not cause).
Had to sign to acknowledge the “damage ”.
I also had videos and photos which didn’t cover the bottom of the car.
A few weeks after I returned home, I received a letter listing a bunch of other damage I ’d be charged for as well — including scratches to the door which supposedly required repainting the rear of the car a few days after I returned my rental.
None of that damage was visible to me (or the agent when I returned the vehicle).
None of it was visible on the photos I took when I returned the car so I disputed the claim.
They denied the dispute and demanded immediate payment for the damage.
Since it was a work trip, I turned my photos over to our legal department.
I received a letter from Alamo a short while later saying that they were going to waive the charges in the interest of customer satisfaction.
If I had been on my own, I certainly would have wound up paying the bill for damage which I am certain didn’t happen while the car was in my care.

12.00 mid-day is the cut-off time.
There is no order processing or dispatching on public holidays or weekends.

In this case, we will notify / contact you either when the item is back in stock ready for us to dispatch or to give you an alternative option.
You will have the right to cancel the order if you wish.
eBay gives an estimated delivery date which does not include any supposed delay by Royal Mail / Couriers.
This can include bad weather, system breakdown or staff strikes etc.
These issues are not in our control so please keep this in mind.
We dispatch items with the expectation of a service being provided by the couriers, but sometimes they do disappoint and this can't be our fault.
If the courier is unable to deliver, a card should be left by the relevant delivery company instructing how to organise a re-delivery or where the parcel has been left for you to collect.
If the parcel has been returned to the courier's depot, then they will allow a certain time for you to collect.
If it is not collected within this time, the parcel will be returned to us.
We would then require you to repay the postage cost for us to re-send the parcel back to you.
If the item is no longer required, a refund will be issued less the postage amount.
If for any reason you are not satisfied with your purchase, you can return the item for a refund within 30 days.

Items must be returned in their original packaging with all product tags attached.
Please be careful when clothing is tried on that make up is not worn, or hair products, fragrances, deodorant or other creams or substances which mark or damage the product.
This will only result in your returned item not being accepted by us for a refund.
We will require a postage payment by you for us to return the item to you.
We will keep or await postage payment for the item for a maximum of 30 days, and after this the item will be disposed of.
Items must be returned within 30 days of receipt.
If the item has arrived faulty or we have sent the wrong item, then we shall pay for the return of the item.
The easiest way would be to open a returns request via eBbay.
Once received, we will examine the item and refund your account.
Items becoming faulty after / during wearing will be subject to an inspection of the item when returned to us.
If the fault is considered a genuine factory fault, then you will be refunded.
If it is not a factory fault, the item will be returned back to you after the postage cost to return the item has been paid.
Again we will wait 30 days for this payment to be made, after which the item will be disposed of.
The easiest way would be to return the item for a refund via Ebay returns, and then simply purchase the size or colour required back from us.

Positive feedback is always appreciated, but if for whatever reason there is a problem with your purchase, please give us the chance to resolve the issue.
Hopefully, you will find our customer service very satisfactory.
> Decoupling will need them to make sure their apps work on all different iOS versions.
This isn't even necessarily true.
Just put a cap on the versions of iOS that the app supports and only push out updates for devices with the latest compatible versions of iOS.
That's how most apps work now.
> Also, since Apple can release new iOS and macOS versions frequently.
Isn't the problem that this still isn't frequently enough?
It also makes for some terrible UX.
Even if Apple upped the rate of OS updates to account for minor bug fixes in a handful of apps, why does the user need to perform * a full OS upgrade * every time?
And what does "the developers can be confident that their patch / feature will get pushed out in the new release" even mean?
> This is in contrast to Google.
Google had to delink because there were a lot of Android versions in the wild, each with a huge market share.
I can say without a doubt that if Android versions on phones were consistent like iOS, Google would never have done the releases with OS releases for these apps.
That's a bold claim, but either way it still doesn't explain how bundling app updates as OS updates is "better" for the developers, or the end user.

Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again
Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games.
Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world.
Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four.
That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself.
As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator.
However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes.
NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators.
All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up.
This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match.
Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.
For your information, I will be sending you a transcript of our conversation.
Should you have any further questions or concerns, you can always reply back to that email and we will be able to assist you further.

The dog that would not stop barking and how I got him to stop.
My neighbors got a dog about three years ago.
These neighbors and I share a fence.
It separates our back yards.
Well, this dog snarls and barks and tries to bite me through the fence the entire time I'm out in the backyard.
I've tried to ignore it, talk softly, etc.
but this dog is insane.
The maintenance guys are afraid of it.
So I went and did the neighborly thing and asked them to help me figure out how to get this dog to chill.
I can't even use my yard at this point.
That dog is outside all day long, snarling and yapping non-stop.
I asked if I could give it healthy treats through the fence.
Owner says no.
I asked if we could go in halves on a non-shock bark collar.
Owner says no.
(Edit to say I asked the neighbor at least three times to help her dog.)
Frustrated but not willing to call animal control or anything yet, I hatched a plan.
I bought a very nice portable speaker that is * loud *.
Like, I saved and invested in this.
Now, every time I go to my backyard, I bring my speaker.
There is no daytime noise ordinance here, I checked.
When the dog begins its snarling barking attacking the fence thing, my neighbors (all of them) get to enjoy a little Lamb of God or Rotting Christ or some other great music turned all the way up.
My speaker shakes the table.
It didn't take the neighbors long to put two and two together.
The dog is now kept mostly inside and when it does come out, it's quick or the owner goes out with it.
The neighborhood is wonderfully quiet nowadays.
Edit some grammar errors
Edit again: PSA DO NOT GIVE DOGS ANY TYPE OF HUMAN MEDICATION, LIKE LAXITIVES OR NYQUIL.
This can seriously harm and even kill an animal.
Also, the speaker is a portable pa system from JYX, if anyone is interested.
It was under $200, but I'm poor so I had to save for a bit.
It sounds great for the money, though.
I'm impressed and so are my neighbors.

Liz Truss pledges another £75m in aid to Afghanistan at G7 meeting
A further £75 million in aid is to be given to Afghanistan by the UK to help address its worsening humanitarian situation, Liz Truss has announced.
The Foreign Secretary said the commitment would help save lives and "support stability in the region."
It follows discussions among G7 foreign ministers in Liverpool on Saturday about what co-ordinated action can be taken in Afghanistan, along with how to engage with the Taliban rulers.
The militant group stormed Kabul in a lightning advance in August, as 20 years of occupation of the central Asian country was brought to a close with a hurried allied withdrawal.
Ms Truss said: "The UK is providing vital humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan this winter.
The funds announced today will save lives, protect women and girls and support stability in the region.
We are determined to do all we can for the people of Afghanistan. "
The additional financial support will bring the UK's commitment to Afghanistan to £286 million this year.
It will be used to provide support for victims of gender-based violence and to fund essential child protection services.
The United Nations and aid agencies will prioritise those most at risk including households headed by women and disabled people, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said (FCDO).
Officials said no funding would go directly through the Taliban, instead being funnelled through the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund, World Food Programme (WFP) and other organisations.
The WFP will receive £34 million of the funding announced on Sunday.
David Beasley, the organisation's executive director, said the donation would "help us save many lives."
"What we are seeing on the ground is heart-breaking - 23 million people are facing severe hunger in a country crippled by drought, conflict and an economic crisis," he said.
"Women and children are bearing the brunt of this suffering and, as the harsh winter descends, more and more are slipping into malnutrition and starvation each day."
This week the UN's humanitarian chief warned that Afghanistan's economic collapse was "happening before our eyes" and urged the international community to take action to stop "the freefall" before it leads to more deaths.
Martin Griffiths said: "It's getting more and more dire by the week."
The funding announcement comes after ministers this week faced awkward questions about the Afghan withdrawal effort following a whistleblower's evidence to MPs.
Raphael Marshall, who worked for the Foreign Office during Operation Pitting, claimed just 5% of Afghan nationals who applied to flee under one UK scheme received help as a result of the "dysfunctional" and "chaotic" handling of the situation.
Mr Marshall told the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee that some of those hoping to escape were murdered after being left behind in Kabul.
He also claimed Boris Johnson requested that "considerable capacity" was made available to evacuate animals from a shelter run by former Royal Marine Paul "Pen" Farthing, putting the lives of troops at risk to help aid their departure on a privately funded plane.
The Prime Minister has called the claims "complete nonsense."
At the Museum of Liverpool on Sunday, Ms Truss will have discussions with foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, who are attending the G7 gathering for the first time - most of them virtually.
The Foreign Secretary will stress the importance of working with south-east Asia's "economies of the future" to tackle the current challenges facing the West, the FCDO said.
The invitation to Asian ministers comes after the UK's integrated review on foreign policy announced in March a "tilt" towards the Indo-Pacific, in a move seen as aiming to counter China's growing influence in the region.

When it comes to buying quality gear, a sleeping bag needs to be first on the list.
You can scrimp on all manner of kit but not on a sleeping bag.
A lot of your time when out camping or expeditions will be spent in your sleeping and with Snugpak you are assured quality.
A tried and tested favourite, this British made sleeping bag combines micro pack size with serious performance.
Many view the Softie 12 Osprey the ultimate four season synthetic fill sleeping bag available.
Since 1987, it has been setting the standard for winter pack size performance for others to follow.
Those who know about the Softie 12 Osprey have either used one or wished they had one.
Used from the heights of the Scottish mountains to the bottom of your snow hole.
The Softie 12 Osprey like many of our other sleeping bags in the Softie Original Series have been assigned a NATO Stock Number.
The quilted top of the bag is tailored, pleated, and fitted with a drawcord so it pulls into shape, rather like a jacket hood.
To prevent the 2 - way zip from snagging either the zip baffle or the bag edges, an "anti-snag strip" of webbing is sewn in behind the zip.
Liner Fastening and Hanging Tabs Inner tabs are provided to keep a loose liner in position, corresponding in position with the tabs we provide on our liners.
External tabs allow you to easily hang the bag for airing and drying.
Tapering the bag to a circle foot creates the "mummy" shape which is easy to warm and minimises the weight of material used.
Hard to see in the picture, but a zip baffle runs the full length of the bag, behind the zip, to prevent heat escaping through the zip area.
Buy a left and a right hand to make a double (please check when ordering)
Comes complete with a compression stuff sack, to make the bag smaller when not in use.
Can be used with the Snugpak Exanda Panel to make a wider sleeping bag for more comfort.
This sleeping bag can be made extra long.
Single profiled sleeping bag with one layer of softie insulation.
Snugpak are based in a listed mill built in the 1800s on the edge of the beautiful Yorkshire Dales.
They are very proud to be one of the last manufacturers of quality sleeping bags and insulated clothing not only in the UK but across Europe.
We have a dedicated workforce at our West Yorkshire factory in the North of England who are trained to use state-of - the-art machinery and traditional sewing techniques to bring our ideas to life.
Contact Left Limited is an official supplier for Snugpak and carries a large range of their kit in our EBAY shop.
Contact Left LTD is a leading supplier of kit to the Armed Forces and Close Protection Industry

I was buying new tires.
I found the ones I wanted on a tire store website.
I printed out the page and took it to my local shop.
It was part of a chain.
The guy at the shop checked things out and it turns out that the current price of the tires was more than my printout.
Don’t know where he got the higher price from.
Luckily, the guy was honest and rather than trying to charge the higher price, he sold me the tires for the price I had on my printout.
He said that because I had the printout, he had to sell me the tires at the printout price.
He was gracious about it too.
Been buying tires from them ever since.
The order was processed as a pick up order that means you chose it to be picked up by you.
That's why we are unable to assign a rider for this.
As the order has already been accepted, we are unable to cancel the order at this point.
I understand, but my colleague explained yesterday that we have to be in touch with the warehouse, this has been done for you - so we are awaiting the reply.
As soon as we have the information, we can then let you know the whereabouts of your order

I haven’t seen any comments from Australians yet, so I might as well say a few words.
It ’s difficult to find equipment that ’s unique or out of the mainstream.
Most boards are mass market boards such as sector 9s or Loaded Tan Tien ’s … I have both and I ’m not hating.
If I want something out of the ordinary, however, I buy direct from the manufacturer or through Muir.
Shipping is always a problem and it ’s always expensive.
I really wanted the Tortuga but when it was all priced up, it was over AU$500 (incl. shipping and exchange rate).
Shipping alone was approx. US$100.
I understand this isn't something you have control over … I only wanted to illustrate the considerations and trade-offs made from this side of the world.
Finally, love your boards!
Much respect.
This is the thing people don't get.
The math doesn't say you can't get really sick if you're young and healthy.
Maybe I'm a pessimist, but that's better than thinking you're invincible.
That shit will get you killed.
I think I took it seriously because I've been sick a lot, and I hate it.
I'm healthy in general, but the flu always hits me very hard.
I was scared that Covid was going to be worse.
It wasn't, probably because I didn't get exposed to a lot of the virus, but it was bad enough.
Still took months for my body to return to normal.
I don't know why it affects people differently, but for me it was body pain and headaches that were the worst part.
Thank you for the information provided, I hope you are doing fine.
Please let me verify your # PRS _ ORG # account.
I will be happy to assist you.
Please give me a moment.
Thank you for holding, I'm sorry that your mother hasn't received the egift card, please conform the email that was sent.
Russia warned of 'consequences' if Ukraine attacked
The Group of Seven has warned Russia of massive consequences and severe costs if President Vladimir Putin attacks Ukraine, according to a draft statement.
US intelligence assesses that Russia could be planning a multi-front offensive on Ukraine as early as next year, involving up to 175,000 troops.
The Kremlin denies it plans to invade and says the West is gripped by Russophobia.
Moscow says the expansion of NATO threatens Russia and has contravened assurances given to it as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
At a meeting in the northern English city Liverpool, the G7 delegates said they were united in their condemnation of Russia's military build-up near Ukraine and they called on Moscow to de-escalate.
"Russia should be in no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe cost," the draft statement said, confirmed by G7 sources.
"We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future," the draft said.
For Moscow, the growing NATO embrace of a neighbouring former Soviet republic - and what it sees as the nightmare possibility of alliance missiles in Ukraine targeted against Russia - is a "red line" it will not allow to be crossed.
Mr Putin has demanded legally binding security guarantees that NATO will not expand further east or place its weapons close to Russian territory; Washington has repeatedly said no country can veto Ukraine's NATO hopes.
In 2014, Russia seized the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine, prompting the West to slap sanctions on Russia.
The Kremlin said today that Mr Putin told US President Joe Biden that Russian troops posed no threat and that Moscow was being demonised for moving troops around its own territory.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were very serious conceptual differences between Russia and the United States on Moscow's "red lines."
The G7 comprises Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and the United States, and includes a representative from the European Union.
"We call on Russia to de-escalate, pursue diplomatic channels and abide by its international commitments on transparency of military activities," the G7 said in the draft.
"We reconfirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy Format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk Agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the draft said.
China's Xi and Russia's Putin dominate the G7
Pope calls for 'serious international dialogue' to defuse Ukraine tensions
Pope Francis, in his first comments on the tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine, today called for serious international dialogue to resolve tensions and urged both sides to avoid an armed conflict.
He said he was praying for "dear Ukraine, for all its churches and religious communities and for all of its people, so that tensions there are resolved through a serious international dialogue and not with weapons."
Weapons are not the path to take.
May this Christmas bring peace to Ukraine, "the pope told thousands of people in St Peter's Square for his noon blessing and address.
Ukraine is predominantly Orthodox Christian, with Catholics of either the Latin Rite or Byzantine rite making up about 10% of the population in the former Soviet republic.
Separately, Mr Biden has said he told Mr Putin that Russia would pay "a terrible price" and face devastating economic consequences if it invaded Ukraine.

Scholz, Polish prime minister discuss migration, energy, EU
Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz came to Warsaw Sunday for talks with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki about migration, energy, European Union matters and tensions east of the bloc's border.
He was greeted by Morawiecki, with military honors, in front of the Polish premier's office.
It was one of Scholz's early visits after he was sworn in with his coalition Cabinet on Wednesday.
Poland is a vocal opponent of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will carry Russian gas directly to Germany saying it makes Europe dependent on Russia's deliveries, and exposes it to pressure from Moscow.
Germany's regulator has suspended the approval procedure for the completed pipeline because of legal issues.
The government in Warsaw is also involved in an intensifying dispute with the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, which is withholding pandemic recovery funds from Poland saying the government's policies erode judicial independence there.
Scholz and Morawiecki are also to discuss complex bilateral relations under Germany's new government.
The good neighborly ties are still overshadowed by World War II, especially under Poland's current right-wing government, which is saying Germany owes Poland compensation for wartime damages.
Agnieszka Lada-Konefal, the deputy director of the German Institute for Polish Affairs in Darmstadt, Germany, expects Scholz's government to continue dialogue and contact with Poland, which is an important member on EU's eastern flank and Germany's fifth-largest trading partner.
The visit comes 30 years after the two parliaments ratified a treaty on good neighborly relations and friendly cooperation.
Germany's new foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, was in Warsaw on Friday.
She voiced Germany's support for Poland which has sealed its eastern frontier to migrants who are apparently encouraged by the Belarus government to seek illegal passage.
She also called for humanitarian treatment of the migrants stuck at the border.
Poland and the EU say the government of Belarusian President Aleksander Lukashenko is seeking to destabilize the bloc by encouraging migration into its countries.
On Friday, Scholz met with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and later with EU and NATO officials in Brussels.
Scholz, a center-left politician, became Germany's ninth post-World War II chancellor, opening a new era for the EU's most populous nation and largest economy after Angela Merkel's 16 - year tenure.
His government is made up of a coalition of his center-left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats.
The Shuttlebays of the Enterprise-D
The * * Enterprise-D * * of * The Next Generation * had * * three * * shuttlebays.
On the show, we always see Shuttlebays 2 and 3 on decks 12 and 13.
These two shuttlebays were represented by a full-size studio set that could house full-size shuttlecraft sets.
I always loved it when episodes would showcase the twin shuttlebays at the back of the mid-section, neck, or whatever you want to call it.
How come we never saw the main shuttlebay?
It was located below the main bridge on decks 3&4 and would presumably be a massive facility.
Instead of going there, the bridge crew would take a turbolift ride right past it all the way down to deck 13.
In the original * Star Trek *, a miniature set was built and used with a miniature shuttle to give the shuttlebay life.
Characters were sometimes seen talking by doors that opened into the shuttlebay with the miniature set and shuttle superimposed to give the ship scale and life.
Couldn't they have done this on TNG?
We saw Worf and Data launch a shuttle from the main shuttlebay in "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II," but the shuttle launch was seen from inside the shuttle.
We simply see the wall outside the window as the shuttle flies out, quickly replaced by space.
The only time we saw the shuttlebay in full scale was in "Cause and Effect."
We see a space shot of the roll door opening, decompressing the main shuttlebay, and we get a quick glimpse of inside along with a few parked shuttles.
Any ideas as to why the main shuttlebay was never seen outside these two instances?
My apologies again for the inconvenience this has caused you.
We are still looking ways to improve our services and this will be noted as a feedback to one of our valued customer.
Thank you - so this query is with warehouse as stated in yesterdays chat, we have to await the reply to the investigation.

Is there anything else I can help you with?
I see it all the time in my line of work.
And it doesn’t even have to be life or death to be frustrating.
Had a recent patient who needed a very specific knee procedure to walk normally and improve quality of life.
Peer to peer failed.
Insurance says it ’s not medically necessary.
We appeal.
They say no again.
We go to third party appeal.
We submit all the pertinent medical research supporting the need for the procedure.
We even included the second opinion of a different surgeon outside of our program — yeah, he recommends the procedure.
24 hours later, they hit us back with the final “No.
Not medically necessary. ”
My surgeon flips his shit and is like “FINE!
But you ’re going to fucking tell me which procedure you would recommend, because I don’t know another one that is gonna help this poor kid ”.
Of course, they don’t.
And this kid is screwed.
No other option.
As it turns out this procedure is generally hated by insurance because it ’s pretty expensive.
We always have to fight for it, but they ’ll usually agree after an appeal.
Not this time.
The system is so broken.

How was the farewell to Etho was like?
First of a quick disclaimer: I am not the account user but her wife.
I have permission to use this account because I just suck at tech and it kind of helps me with mental health issues (and I do see the irony of a technophobe asking about the redstone titan: P)
Second and far more important disclaimer: I do not want to stir drama nor suspect something wasn't right.
Afaik it was just a change of wind that didn't suit everyone.
I'm just an old fan satisfying a nostalgia streak.
With that out of the way >. <...
So I used to be a huge Mindcrack fan back in the day.
Never missed a release from GuudeBoulderfist, loved the collabs, etc.
While watching a random YouTube feed, I came across a vid detailing Etho's channel history.
Near the end, it touched on the Mindcrack going commercial.
How he didn't see it in positive light and the inevitable refusal to sign the related contracts.
Again, neither going 'pro' nor wanting to keep it casual is a wrong decision and I know people go in different directions and such.
Quick Google led me to this old thread which shows his side of things.
Mostly knowing things need to be carefully said, but what strikes most on face value is that you saw things in a different light but overall stayed on good terms.
This whole story happened after I moved on to other things myself, so it's all kind of new to me.
What I am after is the other side of the picture?
As I said, my mental health isn't stellar, and seeing an old group I was attached to as a fan parting ways without some dumb explosions that are all too common in the polarized public discourse could be kinda nice and stuff.
So how was the response from 'the old gang'?
Did you keep doing stuff together?
Did you slowly drift apart?
Still chat or invite one another to events?
Again, I'm not expecting anything dramatic or to see people at each other's throats.
Kinda the opposite.
I guess in a way, a form of low-key closure of something kinda small in my life to reflect a bit of positivity on my own mentally troubled butt.
P.S. I couldn't help but see the charity fund raiser you had and the buttloads you collected.
That's awesome as heck!
I apologize but we are unable to change the address once it has been placed already.
In this case, what I suggest is you can call the rider once he is nearby already for you to be able to amend the address.
To do this, simply access your order page, tap 'Help and support' and choose the option 'Call rider'.
did you sign out and sign in on your app?
did you do the 2 procedures?
if you did both procedures and didn't solve the issue I can refund the money to your Store Credit account.
that way you can buy the book of your choice immedialtrely.
would that be okay
are you there?
for quality purposes i will have to release this chat if there is no interaction in the next 2 minutes

It was prior to 2018.
I got stranded by US Air in Philadelphia instead of taking me all the way to Newark, and me and a dozen other people were trying to get cars late in the evening.
The counter people were the worst I have ever seen.
A line out the door and they were taking breaks and talking about random non-work related stuff like we weren’t even here.
I had a confirmed reservation went.
After an hour of waiting, I told her what I had reserved and she loudly accused me of lying to her and told me off.
I finally gave up and walked over to Hertz, who charged me a fortune, but they got me a car right away.
I swore to never use Avis again.
Worst car experience ever.
National & Hertz have always been good experiences for me.
Those two, followed by Enterprise.
Enterprise wasn’t really bad in any way but they were never as convenient as National where I could walk up and pick out a car and drive away without waiting forever at a counter.
I know these are anecdotal experiences but I ’ll go out of my way to tell everyone to avoid Avis like the plague.
It ’s true that good customer service will keep customers loyal, and a bad customer experience will drive away 10 times as many more customer opportunities.
French fishermen threaten to disrupt British imports in post-Brexit fishing row
French fishermen have threatened to disrupt British imports in an attempt to press London for more licenses as tensions escalate between France and the UK over post-Brexit fishing rights.
The threat was made on Saturday a few hours after Britain agreed to issue another 23 licenses to French fishermen to alleviate tensions between the two neighbors who have been at loggerheads over the fishing row for the past six months.
France is seeking 81 more approvals to reach 104 licenses needed for its boats to operate in British and Channel Island waters under the Brexit agreement signed last year.
The European Union had specified a December 10 deadline for London to grant licenses to French fishing boats under Brexit, with Paris threatening European legal action in case of no breakthrough.
Underlining that France is entitled to around 80 more UK licenses, a group representing fishermen in the key port of Boulogne-sur - Mer and others along the northern coast threatened late on Saturday to launch protests.
"Protests should be expected... protests that will target British imports," the local CRPMEM fishing industry group for the Hauts-de - France region said in a statement.
The group said its members were "exasperated" by the news of only 23 new licenses and felt "betrayed" by the European Commission, which could launch legal action against Britain over the issue.
The CRPMEM said the protests would be "in line with blockades of ports in Brittany, Normandy and the north of France which took place on November 26."
On that day, French fishing boats briefly blocked ferries and other boats in the ports of Calais, Saint-Malo and Ouistreham, while vehicles were also sent to disrupt traffic seeking to use the Channel Tunnel rail link.
Several rounds of talks between the two sides have since been held but a durable solution has yet to be worked out.

This stuff withers when exposed to any critical thought.
I'm not going to rule out that there are vast swaths of people who don't practice critical thinking, but either way, proving it wrong is no guarantee that it will wither.
After all, we've already had a forensic audit and a hand recount of these votes, and that didn't help.
Should we just keep allowing them to "audit" votes until they get the results they want?
> This is letting Uri Geller try and pull his shit on James Randi.
This is where the story ends and the lie goes to die.
No, it's not.
This is Uri Geller trying to pull his shit on James Randi, not liking the results, and hiring a company whose CEO has claimed he believes Geller's powers are real to "study" his powers and investigate whether Randi is a Communist who's trying to ruin Geller.
If there are no results produced here, they'll ask for another audit.
Or they'll claim that shredded ballots were fed to chickens that were then incinerated.
> At some point, you have to do the actual work of looking at reality and comparing it to what they think and point out where they are wrong.
We've already done this.
Twice.
It hasn't stopped them.
And it's not like this is harmless.
There are already allegations that these people are breaking federal law by not properly securing ballots.
Also mentioned in that article: This company plans to physically canvas parts of Maricopa county to ask people if their ballots match.
How comfortable would * you * be if someone showed up to ask you who you voted for in the last election, knowing that if you don't tell them, your vote might be flagged and discarded?
How sure are you that this company is going to keep that data private, and not let others in your community know?
And would you be as likely to vote if you knew that was a possibility every time?
I know plenty of people who wouldn't.

Time is running out for Iran nuclear deal, Germany says
Germany's foreign minister warned on Saturday that time was running out to find a way to revive a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Iran, speaking after meetings with her counterparts from G7 countries.
Talks have resumed in Vienna to try to revive the nuclear pact, with both sides trying to gauge the prospects of success after the latest exchanges in the stop-start negotiations.
"Time is running out," German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters in Liverpool, England where G7 foreign ministers are meeting.
It has shown in the last days that we do not have any progress.
Baerbock said Iran had resumed the talks with a position that set the negotiations back six months.
The current round of talks in Vienna follow a pause of five months after the election of a hardline anti-Westerner as Iran's president, Ebrahim Raisi.
Earlier, U.S. officials said Secretary of State Antony Blinken had held a "productive" meeting with counterparts from Britain, Germany and France on Friday, discussing the way forward for the Iran talks.
A senior State Department official said there was an "intense" conversation among the G7 countries, which were united in their position on the nuclear talks.
"The statement will also be strong on the importance of getting Iran back to the table and that it is possible to conclude a deal but that the time is shrinking, so we're united in that," the official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity, said.
The official added that U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley was heading back to Vienna for talks.
Iranian officials have previously said they were sticking to their tough stance.
Under the original nuclear deal, abandoned in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump, Iran limited its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions.
The West fears the program would be used to develop weapons, something Tehran denies.
Raisi said on Saturday that Tehran was serious in its nuclear talks in Vienna, the official IRNA news agency reported.
The indirect U.S. - Iranian talks, in which diplomats from France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China shuttle between them because Tehran refuses direct contact with Washington, aim to get both sides to resume full compliance with the accord.
The G7 meeting which is expected to result in a joint call for Iran to moderate its nuclear program and grasp the opportunity of the Vienna talks.

Aston Villa latest Premier League club to suffer Covid outbreak
Aston Villa have become the latest Premier League outfit to suffer a Covid outbreak, with a number of positive cases discovered at the club.
Sunday's training session at Bodymoor Heath was cancelled as a result, a session that was designed for just a small number of players' recovery after the loss to Liverpool on Saturday.
It is not thought to be a serious outbreak at this stage, with The Athletic reporting that just one player has tested positive, with the rest being staff at the training ground.
Villa face an away game at Norwich City on Tuesday night in the Premier League and there is no suggestion that it will be cancelled, with training also expected to go ahead as normal on Monday.
The identity of the player that has tested positive has not been confirmed, nor whether it was any of the men who were involved against Liverpool.
Manchester United have also suffered a Covid outbreak on Sunday and there seems to be more concern about that situation, with the Red Devil's trip to Brentford on Tuesday now reportedly under threat.
Tottenham Hotspur have already been struggling with the virus, with their match against Brighton on Sunday postponed after eight players and five members of staff returned positive results.
Championship sides West Brom and Queens Park Rangers have also suffered outbreaks and QPR's clash with Sheffield United on Monday has been postponed.
Anyone who tests positive for the omicron variant of Covid - 19 will have to isolate for 10 days, as will anyone who has been identified as a close contact of a positive result.

Disabled people in America just aren't treated right, full stop.
It doesn't have anything to do with income or living alone.
Services and consideration for the disabled (as well as the poor) just aren't close to where they should be.
We treat the disabled like crap.
We treat the poor like crap.
Everyone in the US should be ashamed.
You're correct that our society needs to value human life more.
If we did, we'd see these mass gun shootings go down.
We'd see fewer traffic accidents and deaths.
Health care and child care would be affordable and much easier access, and so on.
Unfortunately, American society has "accepted" the statistics of hardship, deaths and other casualties as just "a way of life"... in exchange for "freedom" or some such BS.
I see your comment about being disabled and not being supported as just another example of how America just doesn't support people.
It's in the same vein as the author's point, not a conflict.

Organisations on high alert as techs race to fix software flaw
A critical vulnerability in a widely used software tool - one quickly exploited in the online game Minecraft - is rapidly emerging as a major threat to organizations around the world.
"The internet's on fire right now," said Adam Meyers, senior vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike.
"People are scrambling to patch," he said, "and all kinds of people scrambling to exploit it."
He said Friday morning that in the 12 hours since the bug's existence was disclosed that it had been "fully weaponised," meaning malefactors had developed and distributed tools to exploit it.
The flaw may be the worst computer vulnerability discovered in years.
It was uncovered in a utility that's ubiquitous in cloud servers and enterprise software used across industry and government.
Unless it is fixed, it grants criminals, spies and programming novices alike easy access to internal networks where they can loot valuable data, plant malware, erase crucial information and much more.
Cyber attacks are now seen as the biggest threat to financial stability.
"I'd be hard-pressed to think of a company that's not at risk," said Joe Sullivan, chief security officer for Cloudflare, whose online infrastructure protects websites from malicious actors.
Untold millions of servers have it installed, and experts said the fallout would not be known for several days.
Amit Yoran, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Tenable, called it "the single biggest, most critical vulnerability of the last decade" - and possibly the biggest in the history of modern computing.
The vulnerability, dubbed "Log4Shell," was rated 10 on a scale of one to 10 the Apache Software Foundation, which oversees development of the software.
Anyone with the exploit can obtain full access to an unpatched computer that uses the software.
Experts said the extreme ease with which the vulnerability lets an attacker access a web server - no password required - is what makes it so dangerous.
New Zealand's computer emergency response team was among the first to report that the flaw was being "actively exploited in the wild" just hours after it was publicly reported Thursday and a patch released.
The vulnerability, located in open-source Apache software used to run websites and other web services, was reported to the foundation on November 24 by the Chinese tech giant Alibaba, it said.
It took two weeks to develop and release a fix.
Have a great day
Thank you for taking the time to chat to me today.
Once this chat has ended you will be sent a 'rate my chat' feedback email.
Please kindly fill this in if you have a moment, however if you don't have time then may I wish you a wonderful day and thank you again.
Yep … we guys all have guns.
Even babies.
We all walk around with them like it ’s the Wild West.
I don’t even know where to begin here.
You honestly think that a crackhead would own an expensive gun, and then save up enough money for ammo?
A crack head is not a “professional mugger. ”
If you don’t hear of people being stabbed, so what?
Stabbings don’t get the same press treatment as shootings.
Just because the press doesn’t highlight something doesn’t mean it ’s not happening.
WTF does this have to do with race?
Missed Out on Shiba Inu?
EverGrow Might Be The Next Big Crypto To Explode in 2022
Shiba Inu is the latest meme-crypto to go viral and despite being down almost 60% from it's all-time high, the market cap still stands at an eye-watering $20 billion, making it the 12th biggest crypto in the world by valuation.
A $100 investment at launch would be worth over $2 million today!
Many are no doubt kicking themselves for missing out on such gains, but the reality is that a bet on Shiba Inu was a pure gamble.
Shiba's run was a combination of some very smart marketing and a whole lot of hype, that led droves of investors, with FOMO (fear of missing out) to pile into the meme-coin.
Even the name itself, which was a homage to Elon Musk backed Dogecoin, was all part of the design.
In reality, Shiba Inu offers no tangible utility or value, with seemingly little effort to do so in the future.
Being on the Ethereum blockchain, there would've been plenty of opportunity for development had the team behind Shiba Inu been motivated to do so.
There are, however, several cryptocurrencies that are working to rise above the pack, and back their popularity with real utility and fundamental value.
Just 10 weeks ago, EverGrow Coin ($EGC) was launched by a team of experienced finance, blockchain and marketing experts.
One ground-breaking element of their project is the fact the token pays a stable currency to holders.
In the short time since launch, holders of EverGrow Coin have received over $30 million of binance-pegged USD rewards - a stable, regulated currency pegged 1 - to - 1 with the USD.
The project currently has 110,000 holders according to BSCScan.
With their revolutionary contract, EverGrow Coin quickly grew to over $1 billion in market-cap, but then a major data error on CoinMarketCap, just weeks into the launch, caused mass panic amongst investors.
With such a new project, trust can take time to build, and this panic was exploited by a series of articles, rumoured to have been paid for by rivals of the project, using the incorrect data to try to draw EverGrow investors away from the project.
Over the next month, the errors remained unfixed, and EverGrow sunk to below $300 million in valuation.
Yesterday, CoinMarket Cap placed an alert on EverGrow's page, confirming that the data error had been fixed.
The price has now stabilised, and signs of returning confidence saw an increase of 22% from the recent lows.
However, EverGrow still remains well below the highs achieved before this error.
EverGrow is very different from Shiba Inu.
In addition to the obvious benefits of USD rewards, the team behind the project have already launched a SWAP dApp on their website, have recently revealed the upcoming release of a Crypto Wallet, promising to surpass the features offered by Trust Wallet or Safemoon Wallet, and have a whole suite of utilities, from content creation platform to NFT Market Place & Lending, designed to bring continuous value to investors.
Is EverGrow Coin the next Shiba Inu?
With Shiba Inu, offering little to no utility, valued at around 66 times that of EverGrow Coin, there is a clear argument for an innovative and ground-breaking project like EverGrow to see some serious upside from their current low market cap.
If the team continues to impress the crypto community with their innovation and transparency and can shake off the fear spread among investors by the CoinMarketCap errors, there is a good chance EverGrow Coin could be one of the top cryptos to invest in for 2022.
There's a circularity to it...
I think the meal boxes are an insane proposition.
The math they do is just crazy.
"We're actually saving money because we don't have to go out and buy a whole bottle of soy sauce to try Asian cooking..." Madness.
I think that in the consumer space, cheaper goods at lower margins is the only reason that anyone outside of the upper class has experienced any sort of wage growth.
Wages didn't really go up, but shit got cheaper.
The problem is that we sold out the people below us.
I agree with you.
Some of us need to give up at least some convenience to make society better.
Even if I'm not in the income level that would pay more taxes, I can still buy fewer things that are more expensive so that they can be made by people making a living wage and I can be willing to wait a few days to get it so that some gig worker doesn't have to be worked to the bone...

A dream to keep all children safe this Christmas
Her brother (nearly two) had to be persuaded not to walk off with the baby Jesus.
So there was the usual gentle chaos that attends any gathering of toddlers.
But everyone was so pleased that it had gone ahead when so many other Christmas events have been cancelled as yet another Covid variant hove into view.
My granddaughter is four which means that half her life - half her life! - has been blighted by the pandemic.
Since she became properly aware she has known nothing but mask wearing, obsessive hand washing and keeping your distance.
On several occasions (through various lockdowns) when I saw her I didn't know if I should kiss her or not.
What kind of message does that send into the receptive, super-alert brain of a tiny child?
I dread to think.
I say this not as someone opposed to lockdowns or distancing.
For all the criticism of our Government not a single nation has got it exactly right.
It's been two steps forward, and one back (and sometimes the opposite) since the beginning of 2020.
AND one knew - though many of us during those early sunny months rather enjoyed the luxury of not going out - that all over Britain there were those for whom being at home was hell not heaven.
Children such as Arthur Labinjo-Hughes who became invisible with no school staff to ponder on why he was so thin and ill, no neighbours, no passers-by, no nothing.
Molecular Diagnosis Test Can Detect Omicron Variant In 20 Minutes: Report
Korean researchers have developed molecular diagnostics technology that can detect Omicron variants.
The technology development has been currently completed, and it is expected to take time for commercialization.
POSTECH announced on the 10th that a research team led by Professor Lee Jung-wook of the Department of Chemical Engineering has developed molecular diagnostic technology that can detect the Omicron variant in just 20 - 30 minutes and will publish the results online.
Omicron is a variant in which 26 - 32 mutations in the spike, which is used to infect cells by the COVID - 19 virus.
According to the research team, molecular diagnostics technology can distinguish mutations at the single-nucleotide base, so it can detect "Stealth Omicron," which are difficult to be detected by PCR tests.
Currently, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using three methods to detect COVID - 19 variants: whole-genome analysis, target DNA (mutations such as spike protein) analysis, and PCR test.
In the case of the Delta variant, it can be detected by the current PCR test, but Omicron cannot.
The newly developed technology this time is not a sequencing method that reads DNA or RNA sequences, but the molecular diagnostic technology.
The existing technology screens only specific areas of the virus, but the molecular diagnostic technology was designed to cause nucleic acid-binding reactions only when the COVID - 19 RNA exists, enabling rapid detection.
According to Professor Lee, Omicron has a strong signal for N genes in PCR tests but has a weak signal for S genes.
In the case of "Stealth Omicron," both N and S genes confirmed positive, making it difficult to distinguish from other variants.
The molecular diagnostic technology works in different mechanisms from PCR, detecting the Omicron variant efficiently.
Unlike conventional technology that generally processes up to 96 samples per device, the new technology can process more than 125 in 30 minutes (more than 250 samples per hour).
In addition, this technology does not need specialized equipment, thus can make diagnostic kits simply and easily.
As the method can develop the diagnosis kit in 4 days, it is expected to respond quickly even if a new variant or virus occurs in the future.
"I hope the disclosure of this technology will help us return to normal daily life as soon as possible," said Professor Lee.
We will try to quickly diagnose and respond to new variants that may come out after COVID - 19.
This technology is currently before commercialization.
However, it can be used as an auxiliary in current situations where the PCR test for Omicron has not been developed.
Professor Lee said, "I think this technology will be close to commercialization in the second half of next year after clinical trials.
The reason why I disclose the technology is to share it with others to develop better technologies for overcoming COVID - 19 and to allow underdeveloped countries also analyze COVID - 19 variants. "
I told ya so....
The grocery store I worked at was undergoing a complete and total reorganization.
Aisles were changing, and we were all learning where everything was.
Needless to say, it was chaos.
At the time this happened, we were pretty busy, and I had a line of customers, but Karen decides to skip the line to ask me where something was.
I don't remember the exact item, but it was something like paper plates (or something that would be near them... plastic forks?
straws?).
Since I had a line of customers, I couldn't leave to help her locate, so I told her "I believe they are now on aisle 7."
Before I can even get on my walkie to ask someone for sure, she storms off.
Only to come storming back a couple of minutes later to tell me they are not there.
A manager is now nearby, so I ask him if he can help her, and I tell him that I thought they were on 7, but she said they were not.
He looks confused and says "OK, maybe they are on 8.
I'll help you find them, ma 'am. "
As they are about to walk away, she turns to me and says "You should know better than to tell someone where something is if you don't actually know".
Long story short, she comes back to the checkout, but goes to another line.
As the manager comes back, he leans in and whispers to me "They WERE on aisle 7, like you told her."
HA.... told you so!

Water heater temp and bath issue.
My water heater is set pretty low.
It ’s a small tank in a closet (I live in an old pre-war apartment).
Question is, it does fill the bathtub up all the way without going cold.
If I only bathe once a week (but shower every 2 days or so) and the heater has enough water for quick showers, is it worth turning up the heat for the once a week bath?
Or would I save more electricity heating up my stock pot on the stove and adding it to the bath once the water heater is emptied?
Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice!
I turned up the heat just a little and it did the trick.
The comment about boiling being inefficient is probably correct bc even though the water heater is running continuously, that thing has SO MUCH insulation.
It ’s hard to get to so I ’m leaving it at that temp and calling it a day.
Iran reports lowest number of daily COVID - 19 cases in more than one year
Iran's Health Ministry has registered 1,686 new daily COVID - 19 infections, the lowest tally over the past 460 days, marking a sharp decline in cases as the fifth wave of the pandemic subsides.
According to Press TV, the Ministry announced on Saturday that 58 Iranians died from the disease, noting that out of the new cases detected over the past 24 hours, 286 patients were admitted to hospital.
It added that 6,152,524 people in the country have contracted COVID - 19 and 5,963,373 of the infected people recovered and were discharged from hospitals.
According to the Ministry, 3,126 COVID - 19 patients are in intensive care units (ICU) while 39,951,481 diagnosis tests have been so far conducted across Iran.
Coronavirus figures have been on a downward trend since the government started a mass vaccination campaign.
So far, 58,595,066 people have received the first dose of the COVID vaccine, 49,157,835 have received the second dosage and 2,237,841 have gotten the booster shots.
The total number of vaccines injected in the country reached 109,990,742 doses.
Over the past 24 hours, 19 provinces reported almost no death case or only one dead.
According to the latest figures, eight cities are in the orange zones, 119 in the yellow category, and 321 cities are in blue zones.
There is no city in the high-risk red zone.
Iran's First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber said on Wednesday that the country is fully prepared to roll out coronavirus booster vaccinations.
"Today there is neither concern nor any shortage in the supply of vaccine and the ground is ready for the third and fourth dose vaccinations," Mokhber added.

Free Training on CompTIA A + | Will Cover Full Course
I'm currently delivering free training on the CompTIA A + course.
The course consists of 18 modules and I will be doing a dedicated video on each module.
Some of these videos might be a bit long since it will be a whole module in each video so please feel free to make use of the time stamps in descriptions if you're looking for specific topics only or just want to refresh on certain topics only.
The time stamps are there to make life easier for you so it's your own fault if you end up skimming through the module back and forth like a crazy person looking for their lost teeth.
I will make 20 videos for this course, the first is just the 4 min intro explaining the course, the last will be a dedicated exam tips video and then obviously the 18 videos in between will be your modules.
The training should be enough to pass both the international exams for A +, and the other courses I deliver should also be enough to pass the exams associated if there is a exam associated to that specific course.
If you have a question about a specific topic in a module or the course in general that you would like more clarity on, please feel free to ask and I will try to assist you where I can if I'm online.
Here is the course intro

Front: 1 large pocket and 1 zipper pocket
1.5 Inch wide and 58 inches long adjustable leather shoulder strap
Bag made in a pet and smoke free environment
Naturally tanned with Sunflower oil only, no use of dye or chemicals
UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF HANDMADE LEATHER BAGS -
Bag is made of Genuine Real Goat Leather (Full Grain) processed and tanned naturally with sunflower oil only.
Each vintage leather bag is a totally natural and handmade product therefore the colors and the finish can vary from one piece to the other.
Each bag has a unique antique leather / lightly distressed vintage leather look.
Parts from several hides may be used to make a single leather bag.
So there may be some variation in color and the textures to the different parts of a bag, which will create a wonderfully unique effect.
Because of different craftsman and there may be small differences in the style, construction of the bags is shown on the website.
The lining may be a lighter or darker colour to the one shown in the images.
Please write to us to know the current stock color.
Genuine leather might have very small cut / scars / mark on it.
This does not mean it is damaged.
There may also be visible creases in the leather.
These features show the genuine origin of our leather satchels and messengers bags, they form part of the bag and do not affect its durability.
Pure leather may smell a little when it is fresh but the smell will go away with use.
Please keep it in sunlight and fresh air for a few days.
There may be local customs / VAT charges which are unknown to us and beyond our control.
Buyers are responsible for CUSTOMS at destination.
You know something.
I get what Dave's point was.
It's worse to kill black people than it is to make fun of trans people.
And of course that's true.
But Dave forgot something.
Many people who hate trans people also hate black people.
He hasn't endeared anyone to # blacklivesmatter.
He's just given transphobes another hero and more anti-trans rhetoric.
He's given credibility to transphobia.
And considering the most vulnerable trans people are trans women of colour, he has made them a target for violence.
He left his show because he realized that white people were laughing AT him, not WITH him.
How he didn't realize he's done the exact same thing to trans people is very sad.
You're welcome, one moment please.
I've ordered a replacement item for you, this is scheduled to dispatch on February 19.
I will just arrange a returns label for you now.
A Thief ’s Pants Falls Down As He Attempts To Flee.
So to note, I didn’t witness this.
I was told this by co-workers at my first retail job.
These two guys came to the store.
One of them was pretty infamous in town for always being in trouble with the law.
After a while of browsing, the infamous one left and went back to his vehicle while the other one took a shopping cart, and put a large 500 dollar socket set in it.
This accomplice then waited until the two cashiers at the exit door were busy, then walked right by them and out the door.
Both of them noticed, and asked each other if the guy paid.
When it was confirmed he didn’t, one ran after him.
I was told the cashier shouted for him to stop as she chased after him, but he began running with the cart to the getaway vehicle.
I don’t know if he was one of those guys who liked wearing his pants low, or he didn’t have a belt on.
But I was told his pants started falling down, and he was struggling to pull them up while running and pushing a cart with a heavy socket set.
He then ditches the cart, leaving the socket set in it as he yanked his pants up, and ran to the getaway vehicle, jumping in with his infamous accomplice diving them off.
I'm in HR and have worked payroll in the past.
If someone comes to me and tells me that they're working to get out of a financially abusive relationship and their abuser looks at their paystubs,
we might be able to help!
Depending on the company.
I haven't had to do any of the below but I have had to keep staff off our directories and teach reception to pretend they didn't know who someone was and how to identify the abuser if he came by.
I could make an arrangement to syphon money as an after tax deduction, give the deduction an incongruous name that makes it look like some sort of obligatory deduction and then "remit" that deduction back to you separately.
I'd probably have to have you sign an agreement of course.
Another thing I might be able to do: have a fake email conversation with you about why your paystubs are going missing or why your password isn't working (after you change it) and how we're "trying to figure this out, thank you for your patience!"
We don't have this but some employers can issue all or part of a paycheck onto their own debit card, no bank needed.
Also a lot of employers have various underutilized employee support services.
These can range from counseling help, legal insurance, to discounts and coupons.
It is worth asking what they have so you can take advantage of anything that helps.
Some gyms let you rent lockers.
Not an ideal place to hide stuff as theft is a risk, but it is an option that might work for some.
I've done that several times, it doesn't work.
I issued you a refund of the book.
I am very dissatisfied with the solution, what do I do if the problem occurs again in the next book?
It is a rear occasion that it happens.
I am sorry, due to quality purposes I will have to close this chat if I don’t receive a response in 2 minutes.
I will close this chat now since no response has been received.
Amazing.
But good on you.
Yeah, when I was 16 I applied and got offered a job at a restaurant.
Dishwasher.
First shift they had me close.
Saturday.
We were working till past 1am.
I quit the next day.
Best way to lose a new young worker, by shocking them with that.
Same happened to my friend after I had been working with Pizza Hut for a couple years (didn't make me close until months after I started working and trained up), got him a job there on the spot.
They proceeded to put him on two closes in a row.
He quit.
Unless you advertise a job as a closing gig late at night, expect to lose your workers if you hit them with it too early.
I can see that you've ordered from a restaurant that does their own delivery.
They have accepted your order which is # PRS _ ORG #.
The restaurant called you and they do not have the item that you ordered?

Boris Johnson teeters on edge of favour with Tory MPs
Boris Johnson has long been considered a king of comebacks.
And some Tory MPs hope he'll continue that streak by managing to rescue himself from plummeting poll ratings in the wake of a string of Downing Street parties in defiance of Covid laws.
The prime minister had tangled himself in knots by repeatedly denying any rules were broken before more reports and evidence emerged to suggest the opposite.
First there was the video of No 10 aides laughing while they discussed a Christmas gathering on 18 December last year.
Then Dominic Cummings, once Johnson's closest adviser, promised pictures had been taken of parties, and so with bated breath critics of the government waited for them to surface.
When an image was published on Sunday showing Johnson on a screen hosting a Christmas quiz for staffers tuning in from No 10 and at home, it was not quite the smoking gun some thought would finally skewer him, however.
The Sunday Mirror image shows Johnson with two aides who were dressed up with tinsel and a Santa hat - not socially distanced from one another, and clearly engaged in a social occasion while mixing households.
But it could have been worse.
There have been other parties hosted in No 10 and Conservative party headquarters in which people drank copious amounts of alcohol, played party games, exchanged secret Santa gifts and socialised into the small hours, sources have told media outlets including the Guardian, Mirror, BBC and Times.
Ministers will quietly breath a sigh of relief no pictures of these scenes have been leaked - yet.
While Johnson's attendance at the quiz broke the rules, according to Keir Starmer, the Labour leader and a former director of public prosecutions, Tory MPs think people will look at the photo and judge that it really shows him hosting a virtual quiz - a familiar sight during the pandemic.
The staff, dialling in from other rooms in No 10 while drinking and not socially distancing, cannot be seen.
On Sunday Nadhim Zahawi insisted the picture was just an example of Johnson "thanking his staff" and used it to play down the party scandal as "hype."
He told LBC: "On that front page, I think your listeners will look at that and see a PM in his office, with the two close people that work with him, with no alcohol, taking 10 to 15 minutes to thank and motivate his staff, who have been coming in because they can't work from home."
Much damage has already been done, with mutinous MPs furious at the prime minister allowing a "one rule for them" narrative to take hold, from Cummings to Matt Hancock and more recently Owen Paterson.
Johnson is teetering on the edge of favour with his own MPs; if further photos surface, they may push him over the edge.

Long queues for Banksy's shirts supporting statue-toppling protesters
Crowds desperate to buy shirts designed by the mysterious street artist Banksy have been seen in Bristol, UK.
They were released to support protesters on trial for toppling a slave trader statue during a Black Lives Matter march.
Banksy designed the limited edition "souvenir shirts" to mark the trial of four people charged with damaging a controversial statue in Bristol last year.
"All proceeds to the defendants so they can go for a pint," the artist wrote on Instagram.
Sold for £25 ($33) plus VAT and limited to only one item per person at several shops, the shirt has been in such demand that people queued around blocks to get it.
An almost two-minute long video posted on Twitter shows an endless line of customers.
UK media reported that "thousands" were eager to raise cash for the protesters by purchasing the gray T-shirt, which depicts an empty plinth with "Bristol" written above it.
It refers to a toppled bronze memorial to the 17th century merchant Edward Colston, who was involved in the transatlantic slave trade.
The activists, known as the "Colston Four," are facing a trial at Bristol Crown Court next week, charged with inflicting criminal damage to a monument belonging to the city council.
The men - who have all pleaded not guilty - are accused of sinking the statue "without lawful excuse."
Praised by some for leaving money to various charitable causes after his death, the controversial trader's statue was attacked in June 2020, when a protest supporting the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement was happening in the city.
The damaged plinth and graffitied statue was later recovered by the city council from Bristol Harbour, where it was thrown during the unrest, and re-emerged as a local museum exhibit, alongside a curated selection of BLM posters from the march.
A sculpture of a BLM protester was erected on the empty plinth previously occupied by Colston.
Joe Biden Laments Failure to Stop Global Warming After Deadly Tornados
President Joe Biden lamented the world's failure to stop global warming on Saturday after addressing the deadly tornadoes that swept through several states.
"We all know that everything is more intense when the climate is warming.
Everything, "he said.
"And obviously it has some impact here."
At least 30 tornadoes were reported across six different states causing widespread devastation, and over 100 people are expected killed from the storm.
The president said he did not know the full extent of global warming's contribution to the deadly storms, which he described as one of the "largest tornado outbreaks in history."
He said he would get the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate.
"All that I know is that the intensity of the weather across the board has some impact as a consequence of the warming of the planet," Biden said.
The president praised the reporter who asked him about climate change.
"As usual, you ask always the best question," he said with a wry chuckle.
"How are we going to handle this?" he continued.
"Part of it is acknowledging that the likelihood of fewer weather catastrophes, absent of continued movement on dealing with global warming, it's just not going to happen."
Biden said he was shocked by the record wildfires in the country during 2021, expressing alarm that global warming was a major contribution.
"So we have to act," he said.
Biden said the first step was to save lives and care for the families who were affected by the storms.
"I promise you.
Whatever is needed.
Whatever is needed, the federal government is going to supply it, "Biden said.
He said he would continue to monitor the storm recovery closely and do whatever was needed by the federal government.
"I want folks in all these states to know.
We're going to get through this.
We're going to get through this together and the federal government is not going to walk away, "he said.
"This is one of those times when we aren't Democrats or Republicans."
The president said he would visit the storm affected areas when it was clear he would not get in the way of local rescue efforts.
"I do plan on going," he said.
You can come back any time as our chat service window is open 24 / 7

Wendy Rogers Calls New Zealand PM 'Lenin With Hair,' Claims' Satanic Communists' in U.S.
Republican Arizona Senator Wendy Rogers on Sunday called New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern "Lenin with Hair" and warned against communism in the United States.
Rogers appeared to be criticizing Ardern's COVID response as she referred to Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin in a Tweet she posted along with a short clip of the prime minister.
Rogers didn't further explain her criticism of Ardern in her Tweet.
In the clip, Ardern was speaking about COVID misinformation and New Zealand's efforts to keep people informed about the pandemic.
"More bold Christians are needed in office to counter the satanic Communists in both parties," the Arizona Senator wrote in another tweet on Sunday.
Her Tweet was met with ridicule from different social media users, with one person tweeting back: "Please offer your definitions of Communism and Christianity, because I don't think you understand either."
"I see that Wendy is going all out today, trying to compete with the craziest of the crazy," another person tweeted.
Rogers has been vocal about her stance against communism before on social media.
In September, she called Labor Day a "Communist Holiday" without further explanation.
Her tweet was mocked among social media users, including The Arizona House Democrats, who replied: "Says the heart and soul of Arizona's Republican Party (prove us wrong)."
"You do realize that if you keep falsely calling all good things communist you're only going to make communism more attractive, no?" asked another social media user.
Republican Senator Wendy Rogers warned against communists in America and called for having more "bold Christians" in office.
Writer Shiv Ramdas also denounced the tweet by paraphrasing her own words: "'working is Communism .'"
Separately, Rogers has frequently suggested that Donald Trump won the 2020 presidential election and called for a new election.
"I call for the Biden electors to be recalled to Arizona & a new election must be conducted.
Arizona's electors must not be awarded fraudulently... "the senator tweeted in July.
In July, Rogers campaigned for the election to be decertified and previously launched a petition that she claimed gained 663,000 signatures.
"Things are really taking off!
Let's get to 1 million ASAP.
Audit results are coming soon, more states are coming online, "she tweeted in September.
The Trump supporter has also pushed for debunked claims of voter fraud in Arizona.
Newsweek contacted Senator Rogers' office for comment.

'Interview with the Vampire' author Anne Rice dies at age 80
She passed away due to complications resulting from a stroke, Christopher Rice said.
Rice's biggest success was her first novel, "Interview with the Vampire," which was published in 1976 and introduced the character of the vampire Lestat, who would be the central character in the 13 - book Chronicles series, the most recent of which was published in 2018.
"I had an idea of Lestat as the man of action, the man who could do things that I couldn't do," Rice said in a talk at Southern Illinois University in 2010.
"Interview with the Vampire" was made into a successful feature film in 1994, helping to reignite interest in the vampire genre which continued with the TV series "The Vampire Diaries" and the "Twilight" film series.
Although she lived most of her life in California, Rice was a native of New Orleans and set many of her stories there, according to her website biography.
Rice's son, Christopher Rice, said he was at his mother's bedside when she died.
Anne Rice will be buried in a private ceremony in New Orleans, with a public memorial planned next year, he said.
Apple Music Documents & Data Storage Size
Recently, I made the switch from an iPhone 12 Pro to a 13 Pro Max, and on both iPhones I have noticed a bug that is eating up my internal storage.
Apple Music ’s Documents and Data are using about 35GB of internal storage.
I have tried remediating this by deleting the app, but since this is a stock app the documents and data are never truly deleted from the iPhone.
I thought that once I moved to the new iPhone 13 Pro that the bug would disappear, but that was not the case.
After installing from an iCloud backup, I checked the Apple Music app and it was still using more then 30GBs for documents and data.
After contacting two Apple Support specialists, one suggested that I wipe my iPhone and start fresh, while another didn’t offer any real suggestions as the issue goes beyond anything they can do.
I also checked my iPad and it seems AM is only using 15GBs for documents and data on it, but that still is not acceptable.
Now I am turning to the community to see how widespread this issue is, and maybe get Apple ’s attention on this issue.
Have you experienced this as well?

Why were Skyler and Walt Jr. so annoyed with Walt working on the house in season 2?
Specifically 2.10 "Over"
Walt replaces the hot water heater, then replaces boards that were apparently maybe not necessarily rotting.
Why does Skyler seem so pissed about this?
Fed up completely, she asks "Are you even going to work today?"
A week or two prior, she was gung-ho about him resting and recovering the entire time.
I understand she's unhappy in the relationship, but Walter Jr. seems vaguely annoyed and completely puzzled by Walt doing some renovations.
I'm also aware Skyler is openly flirting with Ted in the hope that someone treats her as a priority for a change whilst carrying a child whereas Walt has made everything about him ever since his 50th birthday.
Still, I always find it odd on rewatch that Sky and Jr. seem so incredibly ticked off that Walt is doing something productive at home, not lying or killing people or making drugs.
Just fixing up the house like a homeowner would and should with nothing but spare time.
I also understand this is just another form of desperation to attempt to retain his role as husband and family man despite a day or two prior forcing tequila onto his teenage son.
He's clearly trying to get back in their good graces by hyping up an issue that isn't an immediate priority to make it seem like he's done a terrific job and is a terrific person!
He clearly sucks at damage control.
Regardless, the reaction from his wife and son still always rubbed me the wrong way and felt forced in this situation to try and highlight Walt's desperate bid to make up for ugly mistakes.

In some communities, the church provides a safe place for some persecuted social groups.
It ’s not a coincidence the civil rights movement was very much intertwined with minority churches, masjid, & temples.
Ahmad Aubrey ’s trial is also an example of positive impact.
The Satanic Temple is also doing good stuff.
However, examples where something is very wrong with the system has always been evident.
Religious organizations and institutions should generally be held to the same standards as any other charitable organization.
Transparency is the name of the game.
Looking at cases like the Catholic Church, it might be advisable to ensure funds acquired by these tax-exempt religious organizations don't leave the country.
When I think of religious memberships, perhaps a co-op model is useful; each member gets a single vote as a stakeholder.
Hopefully, they are at least contributing to Social Security.
I am not familiar with Teleloading.
However if you want to open a recent purchased book from # PRS _ ORG # in your # PRS _ ORG # e reader you would only need to sync your e reader via WiFi and download the book in your e reader to start reading, computer or email transfer is not necessary.

I would need to know if the book shows error message, seem blocked or not even appearing in your # PRS _ ORG # account inside your # PRS _ ORG # e reader.
I think it's possible (but I don't know) they were telling them it wasn't safe to drive.
When tornadoes get that imminent, the weather guys usually do that "Take cover now!!"
thing because you don't know if it will be in two minutes or ten minutes or what.
I don't know what right they have to actually forbid people to leave, but I could see where they would be telling them to take cover.
Can you imagine all those people trying to get out of the parking lot when that touched down?
They'd all have been killed.
BUT if they were like "Keep working!"
instead of "Take Shelter!",
that's different.
Does anybody know if they were still working or if they were sheltering in there somewhere?
Yes that means when I work out I really don’t care how many calories it burns, and I don’t change my numbers or macros because of how much I burned.
I (try) to stick to the 1200 - 1300.
But if I ’m extra hungry, yes I ’ll eat something more to fuel my body and accept that weight-loss might be a day slower, or not.
If you ’re already doing a 500 calorie cut, an extra piece of steak or even bread after a hard workout is not going to ruin your progress at all.
It might just narrow your deficit that one day.
An extra piece of pizza or bowl of ice cream though?
That ’s a no go.
If you always need to eat more because of working out, consider not cutting so many calories in the first place.
Maybe start with 300 deficit.
Hope this helps!

PlanetJupiter finally left my office ’s solar system
I posted some years ago about my office nemesis, a woman called PlanetJupiter in my stories.
Not much to say here.
The last time I saw her before Corona, she had lost some weight and seemed to be paying a bit of attention to food groups when she ate lunch, though she was still using her power wheelchair and being a bit smelly.
I asked how she is, like I ask all my co-workers if I see them.
“Not so good, OP, I found out I have diabetes, so I have to eat fewer carbs. ”
To her slight credit, the lunch had cauliflower rice instead of regular.
I am a Midwesterner, and have always been nice to PJ ’s face, so I told her I was sorry, that sucked, what about this project we ’re both on?
Will she also work late to get it done for the court deadline?
“Sure, OP.
I am saving money to move. ”
This is really rare.
My state has the lowest out-migration of any state, ever.
Where is she moving?
To another Midwest city that works a lot in the beef industry.
I hope they didn’t mistake her for a steer!
It turns out me and others documenting all her slow / bad work, falling asleep at the desk, annoying others, and smelling, has caused her to lose out on positions with all but one of the companies that often hires me, her, and others for contract work.
So she sort of has to move to where family is in that city.
She ’ll go blight another workplace, but at least not mine.
Not that it matters now, because I got a much better remote position.
Assam Anti-CAA Outfits Pay Tributes To People Who Died During Protests
Five agitators were killed during the anti-CAA stirs in Assam two years ago.
Several organisations in Assam on Sunday paid tributes to the five agitators who were killed in the anti-CAA stir two years ago, and resolved to resume the movement against the Act.
Memorial meetings were organised at the residence of Sam Stafford, one of the agitators who died, and a playground in Guwahati, with attendees resolving to once again to intensify the stir against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.
The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), which was among the first groups to organise protests against CAA after it was passed in Parliament, paid tributes to the agitators at Sam Stafford's Hatigaon residence.
Sibsagar MLA Akhil Gogoi, who was a Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti leader during the stir and was jailed for his role in it, while paying floral tributes at the photographs of those who died, said that political parties and "nationalist organisations" must take the lead in resuming the movement.
Commenting on the artiste fraternity that had taken the centerstage in the 2019 stir, he said, "We can't expect them to organise agitations.
Their help is crucial but they shouldn't be blamed for not reviving the movement. "
All Assam Students' Union (AASU), another key player in the stir, organised a memorial at the Hatigaon Higher Secondary School playground.
Speaking on the occasion, AASU chief advisor Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharya said, "It is wrong to say that the anti-CAA movement has died out.
It had lost its intensity due to the commencement of examinations (in January 2020) and then the pandemic and lockdowns.
We will resume the agitation with full intensity once again.
We won't let the sacrifices go in vain, "he said.
Mr Bhattacharya said the anti-CAA agitation will once again be a pan-Northeast one like in 2019.
Singer-music composer Zubeen Garg, who had taken a leading role in the 2019 protests, also paid his tributes at the programme organised by the AASU.
"We won't accept the CAA and that is for sure.
The government is trying to confuse us, but we won't allow them to make us accept it, "he said.
Several organisations, including AASU, North East Students' Organisation (NESO) and Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), had observed "black day" on December 11 to mark two years of the passage of CAA in Parliament.
This year's trend for a second Christmas tree in the bedroom sends sales of smaller spruces soaring
Got just the one Christmas tree?
Then you could be behind the times.
This year's trend is for a second tree in the bedroom, and it has sent sales of smaller spruces soaring.
More than a quarter of British homes now boast two festive firs, experts say - and it could be more than a status symbol.
Both the soothing green colour and the pine aroma are said to be good for mental health and sleep cycles - while even fake trees can help evoke a feeling of nostalgia.
Other families get two trees so children can decorate one as gaudily as they like, providing a place for any home-made masterpieces, while leaving a more elegantly garlanded fir on more prominent display to impress the neighbours.
Among those buying into the trend, which started in the US, are Carole Middleton, mother of the Duchess of Cambridge, who gets a second tree for grandchildren George, Louis and Charlotte at her home in Bucklebury, West Berkshire.
Last week, she posted on Instagram: "Once again this year we plan to have two Christmas trees: one for the children to decorate and one which I do myself."
British Garden Centres said sales of smaller trees are up 50 per cent this year across its 58 sites.
Director Boyd Douglas-Davies, who is also president of the Horticulture Trades Association, said: "People are trading up from a plant in the bedroom and putting in beautifully decorated trees."
Fellow garden centre chain Squire's reports that 30 per cent of their customers plan on having at least two trees - and more than one in ten intend to have three or more.
Chairman Sarah Squire said: "They give a bedroom a lovely, calming scent that is the perfect aid for a good night's sleep."
Just as bedroom plants have been known to help mental health and purify the air, trees are also said to aid slumber.
Sleep expert Carl Walsh said: "Our brains collect information from our surroundings and this translates into signals releasing hormones in response.
In this instance melatonin and cortisol are the hormones that control your sleep cycle and put your body into a sleepy state. "
He added that a bedroom tree could also transport people back to a more carefree and youthful era.
"Christmas can be a pretty stressful time.
A bedroom tree takes people back to their childhood when they had no responsibilities and can forget about stressful things.
That is always good for sleep. "
I am afraid I would not be able to confirm the price of the bed until it is available on the website again as it was reduced in our winter sale it is likely this will not be the price of the article when it is added back to the website
Sorry for the inconveniences
Is there anything else I can assist you with?
This is the first time and I hope the last.
Have a wonderful rest of your day and happy new year!
Makeshift Munster crush Wasps in Champions Cup cracker
Munster overran Wasps in a thrillingly chaotic Heineken Champions Cup clash contested by makeshift teams besieged by Covid and injury problems.
A rollercoaster first half ended with Munster leading 13 - 7 after Wasps skipper Brad Shields had been controversially sent off for a dangerous tackle on Dave Kilcoyne.
And with hooker Dan Frost sin-binned on the stroke of half-time, their 13 men were on the ropes and Munster reacted by engineering tries for debutant Patrick Campbell and Andrew Conway.
Alfie Barbeary's all-action display capped by a captivating try had given Wasps hope but he was unexpectedly replaced at half-time and it became one-way traffic from the moment Campbell showed his class to finish in the 43rd minute.
Missing 17 players to injury, Wasps also had to contend with the loss of four more to Covid in the morning, resulting in a hasty reconfiguration of the team.
Munster, meanwhile, were missing 34 squad personnel because of quarantine following their recent ill-fated United Rugby Championship trip to South Africa, creating five debutants in the starting XV and another seven on the bench.
Crucially, however, Ireland stars such as Tadhg Beirne, Peter O'Mahony, Conor Murray and Keith Earls were present to stiffen their ranks.
For all the absentees, it was an enjoyable spectacle where it appeared at times anything could happen, at least until Munster showed the extraordinary depth of their playing resources to pull clear.
Wasps' Covid-affected start to the day was compounded when play got underway, with Thomas Young denied a certain try by O'Mahony's excellent covering tackle.
And while Joey Carbery sent a penalty between the uprights to draw first blood for Munster, Jimmy Gopperth struck the crossbar to continue the two-time champions' unfortunate opening.
But their scrum was offering a foothold in the game and it took feverish defence to keep their maul at bay until they produced the first of two turnovers in quick succession.
Munster were fighting for every ball in defiance of their absentees and their victory prospects received a dramatic boost when Shields was shown his dubious red card, with referee Romain Poite saying his shoulder had caught Kilcoyne's neck.
Carbery directed a simple penalty at the post and while he was on target soon after, a dramatic twist followed as Wasps plundered a stunning try through Barbeary.
It concluded an exhilarating spell of end-to - end rugby in which the rivals took it in turns to attack from deep and, having been at the heart of the home advances, Barbeary delivered the telling blow.
A kind bounce off Murray's kick presented Earls with the simplest of tries as Munster hit back and then Frost departed for the sin-bin as the home side were reduced to 13.
It did not take long for the advantage in personnel to be felt as Beirne started a breakout try that ended with full-back Campbell producing a brilliant finish.
And Munster were out of sight in the 49th minute when a loose pass during a promising counter-attack fell for Conway to scoop up and complete a simple run-in.
Hooker Scott Buckley, man of the match on his Munster debut, was the next over from a lineout move and that was the game won, although Michael Le Bourgeois picked a quality line to improve Wasps' final score.
France reacts to rival offer of US frigates to Greece
The defense ministries of France and Greece have both confirmed that a competing offer from the US will have no impact on an already "signed" and "final" multibillion deal to purchase French Belharra frigates.
France's Ministry of Armed Forces stated on Saturday that a defense contract with Athens had already been "initialled a few days ago," before the US State Department announced its approval of a potential sale of American frigates.
Since we have been in discussion with the Greeks, the American offer is no longer on the table...
We also signed the contract with the Greeks.
Greece's Defense Ministry also confirmed that the deal with Paris was "final," since it had been negotiated at the "highest level possible" and "personally announced" by the Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis.
The finalized contracts are allegedly expected to be ratified by the Greek Parliament "soon."
The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said on Friday it had approved the sale for $6.9 billion of four Lockheed Martin combat frigates, and a separate $2.5 billion program to upgrade Greece's MEKO class frigates.
The announcement triggered some concerns over the Athens-Paris agreement, especially after a long-existing submarine construction "deal of the century" between France and Australia was abruptly tanked by a bombshell AUKUS pact in September, without any prior warning.
Outraged Paris accused Washington and Canberra of a "stab in the back," while just two weeks later Macron took the stage with the Greek PM to personally announce the sale of at least three French warships to Athens for around $3.5 billion, saying it was time to "stop being naive" while touting the new deal as a sign of "Europe's strategic autonomy and sovereignty."
This time around, according to the French military, the US "had warned us that this announcement was going to come out" and that Americans allegedly had "no inclination to go further" with an actual sale of their frigates.
Customer gets mad at me because I didn't know he needed help
I work at a grocery store shopping for pickup / delivery orders.
I often have customers ask where an item is and they ask in the form of a greeting + question, or just a question.
I also have customers that just say hello / good morning / etc.
I passed by a customer who said hello, and I said hello back, then waited a few seconds to see if he had a question.
He didn't say anything else, so I moved on and continued shopping.
He then said "hello?" again, in a rude tone, and asked if I worked here angrily.
I said I did, and he asked where an item was, again in a rude tone.
I pointed where I believed it would be located, and said that I thought it should be there but it looks like we were out of it.
He then just said "forget it" angrily and walked away.
How was I supposed to have known he needed help?
He just said "hello" which plenty of customers say to be polite.
This is the only customer I've had who has just said hello without asking a question, then expected me to know he needed help.
He didn't say anything rude to me, but his tone of voice was extremely angry the whole time, even though I tried to help him.
Heavy snowfall wreaks havoc in Serbia and much of Balkans
Heavy snowfall wreaked havoc in much of the Balkans on Sunday, disrupting public transportation.
Flights were cancelled at Serbia's main airport in Belgrade on Sunday and many areas reported power cuts and damage to buildings.
Much of western Serbia was without electricity as authorities warned against unnecessary travel and appealed to people in Serbia to conserve power.
There was some damage to cars and buildings in Belgrade due to the snow.
Several flights from and to Belgrade's main airport were cancelled because of the weather conditions and a brief power cut to the main terminal, Belgrade media reported.
A highway leading to the airport was closed for several hours because of a traffic jam caused by the snowfall.
Passengers on a local train to Belgrade were stuck in snow for seven hours before they were provided bus transportation to the capital.
Emergency services have been assisting authorities in the cleanup operation, while another alert for more snow and ice has been issued.
Meanwhile, in Bulgaria, heavy rains and major floods have been ravaging southern parts of the country over the weekend, forcing authorities there to declare a state of emergency.
The worst-hit areas were in the Smolyan region, near the border with Greece, where rivers burst their banks to cause the overflowing of roads and the flooding of homes.
Several trucks were trapped in a landslide on an intercity road.
Strong winds disrupted power supply in dozens of villages, authorities said.
Further south in Albania, authorities mobilised police, army and emergency forces to cope with floods following three days of continuous rainfall and snow.
The Vjosa River in the south flooded many areas.
An older couple who had stayed overnight on the rooftop of their house in southwest Albania was rescued by police in the morning.
Many roads were temporarily blocked by landslides in the south.
Elsewhere in the northeast and southeast of the country, heavy snow has hampered or temporarily blocked traffic.
We had power go out a couple of times.
Step 1: Get someone on the door immediately.
They are security now.
Don't let anyone in and pay attention to people as they leave (esp kids' hands).
Step 2: Call Store Manager if they aren't there.
Step 3: Those that are at tills and anyone else really are free to wait a couple minutes to see if backup generators can get us going again.
Step 4: Go throughout the store and getting every non employee to leave.
As well as every cart brought to the front.
Step 5: Go through the carts looking for anything cold and produce.
Step 6: Return said cold / produce.
Step 7: Cover all non-doored cold i.e. cheese / meat / veggies, etc.
Step 8: Sign our names on a sheet of paper as we left to be clocked out.
(Some were allowed to leave earlier, esp if they weren't comfortable in the dark or didn't still have 6hrs to go).
It's really dark, even upfront.
No way can we let customers just hang out.
I'm not sure why some tills still had some power while others didn't.
Not sure, but I don't think we had any way of having them pay.
I do think items would scan, but no way would we trust the customers to pay later.
One time it took only like 3 hrs for power to go back on.
They had a few of us stay so if it did, as they were told by the power company it should, we could reopen.
I don't mind, as long as we have the choice to stay or not, helping out preserving product as best as we could.
Not having a choice, as well as endangering customers, is where I draw the line.
This Arab state plans to boost trade with Russia
The United Arab Emirates plans to increase its trade turnover with Russia to $20 billion in the next five years, the country's Foreign Trade Minister Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi has announced.
"We are working with the Russian side to increase trade turnover to $20 billion over the next five years and to continue investing in other areas [of economic cooperation]," Al Zeyoudi told RIA news agency on Saturday during a plenary session of the Expo - 2020 international forum in the UAE, which had been postponed due to the Covid - 19 pandemic.
According to the official, "relations between Abu Dhabi and Moscow are strategic."
He noted that up to 90% of all Russian investments in the Arab world are made in the UAE.
The UAE also significantly invests in Russia, making up some 80% of all Arab investments in Russia's economy.
"If we are talking about the number of Russian companies in the UAE, it has reached almost 4,000," Al Zeyoudi stated.
According to the minister, the UAE is already investing in several Russian sectors, including the petrochemical industry, oil and gas, the automotive industry and ports, and it plans to broaden this list.
In 2020, the trade turnover between the two states reached $3.3 billion, and in the first 10 months of 2021 its volume exceeded $4 billion, reaching a new record, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said last week.
According to the Ministry of Economics, this year Russia mainly exported mineral products, precious stones and metals to the UAE, while Russian imports from the Arab country included machinery, equipment and vehicles.
Dallas Cowboys bring benches to Washington, rivalry heats up
The visiting sideline at Washington has a familiar home look for the Dallas Cowboys.
After getting word from other teams that the sideline benches at FedEx Field were in major need of an upgrade, the Cowboys brought their own for this showdown game.
When they arrived at the stadium Sunday, they were already decked out in Cowboys logos and wordmarks.
The Cowboys heard from the Seahawks, who recently played against Washington on a Monday night and had complaints that the heated benches were malfunctioning.
Earlier in the week, Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott actually commented about the benefits of playing outdoors in colder games, because of the heated benches are beneficial to his knee injury.
The Cowboys just made sure Zeke and his teammates got that opportunity.
This move is just the latest twist in the Dallas-Washington rivalry, one that got juiced up even more this week when Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy predicted a win for his team, prompting some fireworks back and forth with Washington's Ron Rivera and players.
Washington has beaten the Cowboys in consecutive matchups.
It has been more than 30 years since it has defeated Dallas in three straight meetings (1986 - 88).
Cowboys fans made up more than half of the crowd at FedEx field, which was evident based on the blue and white jerseys in the stands.
Owner Jerry Jones foreshadowed that earlier this week when he said on 105.3 FM in Dallas, "We have always sold more Cowboys' hats, caps, T-shirts.
We've always had our greatest fan support positive coming from Washington, that's outside the Dallas area.
Outside the Texas area, Washington is where we have the most support of all when it comes to all the things you might count. "
Warning of stormy weather as strong winds present 'danger to life'
Storm force winds are set to batter northern parts of Scotland with disruption to travel, especially ferry services, expected.
The northwest, Shetland and Orkney will face gusts of up to 85mph overnight on Sunday into Monday morning.
The Hebrides, and western coast of the Highlands and parts of Argyll and Bute have been warned to be prepared for flying debris presenting a "danger to life" and causing damage to buildings.
Experts are warning that the bad weather could lead to power cuts, road and bridge closures, and cancellations to air and ferry services.
It follows two named storms, Arwen and Barra, that brought widespread disruption to large parts of the country.
More than 100,000 homes had their power cut off by the extreme damage wrought by Storm Arwen on November 26 and 27.
Storm Barra disrupted supplies to around 10,000 just 11 days later on December 7.
STV weather presenter Philip Petrie said it was very nearly three in a row.
The Met Office were keeping an eye on a low pressure system that is skirting along northwestern areas overnight on Sunday bringing with it very strong winds and squally, heavy showers.
The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for wind with the first coming into force from 9pm on Sunday covering the Western Isles, and parts of the Highlands and Argyll and Bute.
"Within this area there is the potential of gusts reaching 80 - 85mph causing disruption to ferries and also some damage and power cuts," Philip said.
A further warning comes into effect at midnight on Sunday covering Orkney and Shetland.
"This warning lasts until midday Monday as the centre of the low pressure system moves close to the Northern Isles, again bringing gusts of 80 - 85mph along coasts and locally in excess of 90mph in some areas," Philip said.
"It is very fast moving though, so will clear away by Monday afternoon, with things beginning to ease and calm by lunchtime.
For the rest of the week things will continue to settle ahead of next weekend. "

Students played the leading role at the Annual Academic Conference of Zhejiang University with creative research achievements - Xinhuanet
Washing hands with air, diagnosing disease through breath, and accurately seeking for source of smog; last night, a series of creative academic achievements were awarded at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Annual Academic Conference of Zhejiang University.
The main researchers of these achievements are students, with research covering major fields of environment, machinery, energy, medicine, life science and humanities education; students created many high-end inventions with application values from a curious idea, and some of them have won awards at home and abroad.
Biosensor: your home physical examination doctor
The team of Zhang Diming, a doctoral student of School of Biomedical Engineering, showed a biosensor on the smart phone with the size of only a half of a smart phone.
“All you need to do is to breathe out, and this set of instrument can detect your physical conditions preliminarily from the components of the air you breathe out. ”
Zhang Diming introduced, this set of sensor is connected to the smart phone; after you breathe out, the health report will be shown on your phone.
Smart bands on the market which can detect health conditions often measure physical parameters such as temperature and pulse.
This set of biological sensor uses the new material of graphene; its target is chemical elements, and its keen “sense of smell ” enables it to reflect the health status of the body more in-depth and accurately.
Smart operation lamp: high-functioning eyes for doctors
In addition to smart phones, smart operation lamps are now being used in operating rooms.
This invention has won the silver prize in the 44th International Exhibition of Inventions in Geneva, Switzerland this year.
The team of Zhu Linjing and Shen Junfei, two graduate students from School of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering, developed a new idea trying to solve the defects of traditional operating lamps and invented the smart LED operation shadow-less lamp.
“Improper early detection of many diseases and inaccurate excision are related to operation lamps used by doctors. ”
According to Shen Junfei, for example, in early inspection of cancer, if doctors cannot see clearly all the tumor tissues in a timely manner, the tumor cells will still spread.
This type of smart operation lamp has four lamp panels, which enhance the distinction degree of different tissues by adjusting the spectrum.
During the operation process, doctors can adjust the size of light spot, brightness, spectrum, color uniformness and shadow-less degree any time according to demands of operation and personal habits.
This type of smart operating lamp has been tried in hospitals such as Sir Run Shaw Hospital Afflicted to Zhejiang University Medical College and the Children ’s Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University Medical College, and received favorable feedback.
Last October, this invention won the first prize of the National Challenge Cup Competition.
Washing hands with air: save water in a cool way
Normally, people wash hands by flushing hands with water, with a little soap and sanitizer at most; however, Li Qizhang and his classmates invented a set of “equipment to wash hands with air ”.
As long as we stand on the washbasin of the equipment, our weight can compress the air out.
“Just like an inflator.
The air compressed out can form a flow at the faucet and combine with water.
As such, we can wash our hands clean! ”
Chromogenic reaction and germ residue experiment results prove that the effect of hand washing this way is the same as that of the ordinary method.
This equipment is only driven by our weight, which can not only guarantee we wash our hands clean, but also save 90% of water; the entire process has no energy consumption and is energy-saving and environment-friendly.
Last year, at the 2nd Global Grand Challenge Summit, this invention emerged among all the top universities in the world and was awarded with the only gold award.

A certificate I deem meaningful, Certificate of First Aid
I think this is one of the most important skill type certificate except for driving license!
For your information: first aid measures refer to emergency rescue in emergencies, i.e., emergency treatment conducted before the coming of the ambulance.
As everyone knows, there is a period before the coming of the ambulance after the accident happens, which is most critical.
This period is the most important time for first aid.
If we suffer from heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage or respiratory arrest, our life window is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So it is very important for those around us to know first aid!
When somebody falls down, we can conduct first aid with our professional knowledge, instead of doing nothing and only standing there; this helpless feeling is really frightening.
“In China, 3 million people die from accidents every year according to official data, and the most dangerous one is known as cardiac arrest.
15% of people of cardiac arrest can be brought back to life in the United States.
In the Casino Hotel in Las Vegas, 70% or 80% of them can be brought back to life, and the proportion in Shanghai and Beijing is lower than 1%. ”
Said Lu Le, the founder of the First Reaction.
Pinching philtrum has no effect at all if a person suffers from cardiac arrest and there is no sign of breathing or heartbeat.
Artificial respiration and external chest compression are required to bring them back to life.
I found that very few people have the awareness to study first aid knowledge, but it will be too late once accident happens; therefore, I appeal to everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond timely when faced with emergency situations.
We may bring somebody back to life with this skill!
People can apply for the certificate of first aid at your local Red Cross Training Center, and I applied for my certificate at the Red Cross Training Center in Zhuhai; students are offered with a discount.
PS: The last picture is the goals I aim to achieve before 25 years old; I added the Certificate of First Aid a couple months ago, but I did achieve it!
Next, I will apply for other certificates; I plan to get Diving Certificate; I saw on Red earlier that there is a Diving First Aid Certificate, which requires a Certificate of First Aid first, so getting a Certificate of First Aid is useful!

There is only one 13 - yuan shrimp dumpling!?
I haven’t tried it before.
How can you not write your # NAME # clearly?
Is it 13 yuan for only one?
Yesterday # PRS _ ORG # missed some food in the delivery, and now I only have one shrimp dumping!?
Because I clearly saw the code was valid when I entered it.
I will say my conclusion first; I think Only Fools Rush In is utterly a terrible film in any sense.
But it is not without any highlight; at least the music is good.
There are many types of terrible films; some make you sleep soundly in the cinema, some make you angry after watching it; Only Fools Rush In is like monkeys on Mount Emei; it can ignite your anger in countless ways.
Han Han is super talented in insulting the audience.
The most painful part of the film is that it is hard to describe like a monster in Cthulhu novels, and has as many loopholes as the holes on the trench coat on Javier Mascherano.
After watching it, you may even wonder if there is metaphors the director planted in it; but you will find that it is only a piece of shit after close examination.
I ’ll first briefly talk about some plots that are hard to understand.
The male leading role lives with his grandma on some island in the south.
His grandma has a wish, watching the snow, and the a old male neighbor drove a minibus to take her to watch the snow in the Northeast.
An elderly goes to watch the snow in the northeast from the south in a minibus??
He and his father were okay with it.
And then there is no follow-up on this old lady.
Opening a hotel on an abandoned ship; how does the brother of the female leading role get the license?
How do the racing bike gang on the island easily block a mountain road??
Then the truck delivering steel bars in the middle of the road just stopped at the roadside, and the truck driver was nowhere to be found.
They are obviously props.
Why could a little gangster biker with poor credit and who was suspected of breaking the law become an auxiliary policeman?
Why didn’t he call the police when there was usury involved, and the police specifically asked if there was any problem.
An adult who knows how to use smart phone doesn’t know how to use the card to open the door at the hotel, and it was forcefully arranged for him not being able to find the owner of the hotel and so he slept outside the hotel for the night?
Such ridiculous plots were everywhere in the film; the plots are so ridiculous that I feel painful when I remember them.
In addition to the plots, the theme of the film is even more terrible, or you can say there is no theme in the film; it ’s just a horrible monster that is stitched together.
In the beginning of the film, you may think he wants to make a comedy; after twenty minutes, you may guess it ’s an inspiration film; after a half of it, you may think it ’s a drama showcasing the hardship of a small town boy; after you watch all of it, you don’t even know what you have watched; what follows is deep doubt in yourself; why would you go to the cinema to watch a piece of shit during the Spring Festival?
Most people are familiar with the routines of various films; for example, if you want to make a film about a biker, then make it an inspiration + comedy to tell the audience how a talented rookie achieves success step by step.
If you want to make a love film, just tell the story about a small town boy who loves to ride motorcycle and a girl who works as a waitress.
If you want to reflect reality, then the plot should not have anything that is contradictory to the normal world.
(Such as the character played by Yin Zheng who sang after his new motorcycle was just burned) please don’t think about ideas that are ridiculous.
As for why the female leading role acts like a five-year - old child when she is not retarded at all, I really don’t know if there is problem with her acting or it was demanded by the director.
And one more thing I don’t understand is why Han Han as a racer is so keen on adding the plot of car crash in his films?
Is such a film being arranged in the Spring Festival season to humiliate the audience?

Inspection shaft concrete module production and processing equipment, introduction to Zhengzhou shaft wall brick module equipment:
Zhengzhou Yixin is a specialized manufacturer of concrete inspection shaft module brick equipment, inspection shaft building block machinery and shaft wall module equipment, with semi-automatic and automatic production lines.
Based on practice and development of many years, it is engaged in production of high quality hydraulic type, mobile type and automatic inspection shaft series of equipment and supporting devices.
Inspection shaft concrete module production and processing equipment, the assembly site for Zhengzhou shaft wall brick module equipment
Inspection shaft concrete module production and processing equipment, the characteristics and advantages of Zhengzhou shaft wall brick module equipment
Yixin inspection shaft module brick equipment is widely applied in new-type masonry materials for municipal underground structures for coal, heating, electricity and gas.
Foe example: various types of inspection shafts, gutter inlets, box drains, septic tanks, small-sized structures and wing walls of bridges for drainage and water storage facilities.
The advantage of building inspection shafts using concrete modules is that the four sides of the modules are of concave groove structures, which are built to form chain locks.
The shearing resistance of the shaft wall is far better than the masonry form of the flat friction of the brickwork.
The modules are of hollow structure, with connected holes vertically and interpenetrated horizontally; the cast-in - place concrete mesh structure is formed after pouring of the cores of holes, playing the role of secondary reinforcement and waterproof.
The joint bar grooves are equipped for modules vertically and horizontally; the horizontal and vertical joint bars can improve the overall strength of the structure.
In addition, phenomena such as collapse, sink or water leakage are rare in the inspection shafts and pumping shafts laid with concrete inspection shaft modules, with stable mechanical performance in shaft wall modules, easy operation and standard forming size.
The concrete inspection shaft module brick equipment can automatically control the input and output of the configured data, and the one-key contact crystal display can monitor all the process of mechanical operation to realize ideal man-machine dialogue, automatic analysis on materials, density operation, safety logic control and fault diagnosis system.
Single-cylinder and double-cylinder hydraulic pressure and transportation are adopted for the shaft wall module mechanical and hydraulic system.
The independent hydraulic integration station is utilized to avoid the influences on the hydraulic system caused by vibration of the master so as to ensure reliability of the operation of the hydraulic system.
In the concrete inspection shaft module brick equipment, the fabric box proceeding box de-molds and lifts, the storage box door closes, and the supporting plate is transported automatically, all of which are independently completed by the hydraulic system so as to reduce mechanical abrasion and times of repair.
The concrete inspection shaft module brick equipment is composed by imported computer and appliances, as well as sealing elements and hydraulic element to ensure stable and reliable comprehensive performance.
The integral steel plate is adopted for the shaft wall module mechanical vibration platform, with no welding points of wire-electrode cutting mold closing of mesa, so that the stuffing box can swing and orient freely to greatly reduce mechanical abrasion.
It reduces loads of molds and reinforces vibration; integrated and full synchronization are adopted for vibration of the platform and the molds to ensure the vibration effect.
The shaft wall module mechanical excitation machinery and the computer automatically control the vibration range according to the cost performance of raw materials, leading to no abrasion brake; in this way, it extends the service life and reduces the cost.
The shaft wall module machinery is equipped with dual functions, i.e., automatic control and manual control.

Doctors from South Africa: Although more transmissible, most of the patients infected by Omicron are mild cases
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that patients infected by Omicron are milder cases compared with those infected by Delta, although Omicron is more transmissible.
According to report from the Associated Press, as Omicron is being transmitted in South Africa, a report by a physician organization composed by more than 5,000 doctors in Gauteng, South Africa says that most of the current patients of COVID - 19 in treatment have mild symptoms, such as body ache and cough, which are similar to symptoms of flu.
According to Doctor Unben Pillay, chief supervisor of the organization, he needs to provide medical services to dozens of patients every day, but none of them needs to be hospitalized.
Pillay said, “Their diseases can be controlled at home, and most of them can recover after quarantine of 10 to 14 days. ”
He said that those included aged patients and patients with health problems, who were easier to become severe cases due to infection of the COVID - 19.
He said that, in comparison, the COVID - 19 patients he treated in the last round of epidemic suffered from “breathing difficulties and low blood oxygen.
Many of them needed to be hospitalized within only a few days ”.
Other doctors shared similar experience within 2 weeks after the first report of Omicron the new variant in South Africa.
Although it will take some more weeks to collect sufficient evidence, observation and early proof from doctors have provided some clues.
According to the summary made by National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa, among the patients of COVID - 19 who were hospitalized within the last few weeks, only 30% of them were severe cases, which accounts for a half of the proportion of severe cases of the last round of epidemic; the average stay at hospital is reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the latest patients of COVID - 19 died, which used to be as high as 20% in the cases of the early epidemic phase in South Africa.
By quoting the data from National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa and other reports, Willem Hanekom, Director of Africa Institute of Health said, “At present, almost all the evidence indicates that this is a relatively mild disease. ”
He also said: “However, it ’s still at early stage, and we need to obtain data of later stage.
In general situations, hospitalization and death happen later, and it ’s only two weeks since we entered into this round of epidemic. ”
At the same time, scientists from all over the whole world are observing the number of medical cases and the rate of hospitalization, as well as testing the effect of the current vaccines and treatment method.
Although Delta is still the main COVID - 19 virus strain of the world, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries with South Africa at the center of the epidemic.
According to introduction from health officials, the new cases detected in Gauteng province in the first week of December increased by 400%; according to test results, Omicron variant cases accounted for more than 90%.
Thank you to all the supporters today; all 80 boxes have been given out!

Education news commentary: What should we do to rescue abducted children?
As the famous public service advertising says, “there is no killing if there is no buying ”; in a good environment with no demand of“ buying abducted children ”, if the masses can prevent and fight against abduction together and make abduction an action with no benefit, high risk and cost, then such crimes will not happen again.
Recently, the platform of emergency release of missing children information developed by the Anti-Abduction Office of Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security went online.
This is an Internet information platform established as an authoritative channel for the release of missing children information and timely finding the abducted children.
I feel warm after hearing the App is named “reunion ”.
This new technical means not only has an “artistic ” name and full of warm feelings, but also makes appropriate use of informatization, making itself practical and effective.
The first and foremost objective of fighting against abduction is to find the abducted children and ensure their security and freedom.
The judgment and punishment to the suspect is secondary.
In terms of the significance of criminal punishment, lots of “big words ” can be listed from individual punishment and social prevention to legal education.
However, before solving an abduction case, the safety of the victims should be priority.
There are orders of priority; with the urgent goal of “rescue ”, the discussion on contentious topics with divergent public opinions such as“ if death penalty shall be applied to criminals of child abduction ” can be shelved for now and be discussed with discretion; however, rescuing abducted children cannot be delayed.
According to the experience in solving such cases, human trafficking traders tend to run away from the crime scene as soon as possible after the crime.
Therefore, with each minute delayed in finding abducted children, the children are farther from the parents, and the difficulty of solving the case also increases.
In this case, it is a practical action to present a platform such as “reunion ” which can help solve the case and provide an effective method to find the children.
After all, cracking down on abduction is a major task that requires the coordination of the entire legal system.
To crack down on crimes and protect the interests of children and parents, the care of “protecting the young and helping the weak ” shall be implemented in the improvement of legislation, and in safeguarding judicial system and meticulous enforcement.
In addition, we can do better to prevent abduction of children from the perspectives of both family and society.
Take a common case as an example; parents and a child were taking a rest at the train station, and the parents found their child missing after waking up.
You cannot expect a 2 - year-old child to protect himself / herself; however, as parents of young children, adults shall have at least some degree of protection awareness.
The father and the mother can take turns in taking rest, or they can protect their child in a proper way, which are the basic approaches for protecting children from being abducted.
Viewing from the other side of the crackdown on abduction, the party purchasing the abducted children shall be given attention to and punished, too.
Any single illegal behavior is usually one link of a long chain.
According to the Penal Code in our country, the criminal penalty starting point of child abduction and sale is 5 years; suspects with especially serious circumstance may be sentenced to death penalty with confiscation of property.
Under the trend of “light sentencing ”, the crime of abducting and selling children has a high starting point and heavy maximum standard of sentencing, and thus it is clearly a crime with heavier sentence.
However, there are still lots of cases of abduction every year.
It is clear that some people are still lagging behind in the concept of raising children and have dim legal awareness.
Legal education should be provided to these people.
It requires not only strict enforcement from authorities to effectively control the crime of abduction and selling.
If the “market ” of buying abducted children still exists, and abductors continuously create new ways to abduct children driven by the profits; this will lead to a situation where the criminals and law enforcers plot against each other, and the action to crack down on adduction will inevitably be low in efficiency.
Therefore, correcting outdated concepts and popularizing legal common sense are also conducive to eradicating the crime of abducting, trafficking and buying children.
Yang Haodong publicized the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the CPC and the provincial congress of Party representatives.
Draw energy from the history of the 100 years of struggle of the Party
Report of Hunan Daily on December 10 (full-media journalist: Gong Bowei), according to unified arrangement of the provincial Party committee, on the morning of December 10, Yang Haodong, a member of the Standing Committee of CPC Provincial Committee and the Ministry of Publicity Department of the provincial Party committee, gave a lecture in the Malan Mountain video cultural and creative park, to study the spirit of the sixth plenary session of the 19th central committee, the spirit of the important instructions about Hunan by General Secretary Xi Jinping, and the spirit of the 12th Party congress of Hunan.
In combination of his feelings and experiences, Yang Haodong interpreted the core essence and the requirement on practice of the spirit of the sixth plenary session of the 19th central committee in terms of three aspects, i.e., original aspiration and mission, self-revolution, as well as the young Party, leaders of Party and theory of the Party.
As pointed by Yang Haodong, it is necessary to combine the spirit of the sixth plenary session of the 19th central committee and the spirit of the important instructions about Hunan by General Secretary Xi Jinping, and the spirit of the 12th Party congress of Hunan, to digest them and strengthen the guarding of the “two-establishment ” and the ideological consciousness, political consciousness and action consciousness of the“ two-guarding ”, and to unwaveringly move forward in the direction pointed by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
In the interaction and exchange part, representatives of grass-rooted cadres, representatives of enterprises and representatives of young people asked questions about relationship among the three historical resolutions, correct understanding on decisive significance of the “two-establishment ”, the way for cultural enterprises to master the orientation and the way for young people to abstract energy from the Party ’s 100 - year history; Yang Haodong answered the questions in plain language and with vivid cases, and he hoped the young Party members would abstract energy for progress from the history of the Party of 100 years, be unified around the Party Central Committee and follow the decisions made by the Party unswervingly and write responsibility and undertaking with youth and contributions.

The International Olive Oil Association divides olive oil into two categories, Virgin Olive Oil and Lampante Olive Oil or Refined Olive Oil, and five levels.
Virgin olive oil, also known as natural olive oil, is oil obtained from fresh olive fruit after removing foreign matters by mechanical cold pressing and filtering.
There are three levels according to acidity:
Extra Virgin: is the highest level, best quality olive oil, a pure natural product.
It has premium taste, a slight and pleasant plant fragrance and a acidity of less than 1%.
Fine Virgin: has a slightly higher acidity of less than 2%, tastes pure and aromatic.
Ordinary Virgin: taste and flavor are acceptable, with an acidity of no more than 3.3%.
Refined Olive Oil refers to olive oil obtained from the refining of virgin olive oil with an acidity of over 3.3%, also called as “secondary oil ”.
Refined Olive Oil can be divided into two categories:
Olive Oil: is refined olive oil mixed with virgin olive oil in a certain proportion to adjust the taste and color, has an acidity of under 1.5% and a transparent light gold color.
Refined Olive-Pomace Oil is olive oil obtained and refined from pomace with dissolution method.
After reading the classification, you may find the acidity of olive oil is an important index.
You should know that olives are just like grapes that make wine, olives from different producing areas and different types of olives will produce olive oil of different standards.
The best growing area of olives:
The Mediterranean coastal area has the most suitable soil, temperature, sunshine, air humidity, precipitation and other weather conditions for olive growth.
Aside from the Mediterranean costal area, olives can only be planted sporadically in suitable areas in other areas.
Main producing areas (the Mediterranean):
Italy, Spain, Greece, Turkey, Portugal, Morocco, Syria, Israel, Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt, Pakistan, Lebanon, etc., and Argentina, Peru, South Africa, etc., which are far away in the southern latitude and have similar climate.
Picking time of olives:
March to June each year is the time for olive trees to blossom and bear fruit, and from July to October, the fruit begins to develop and ripen, and the color of fruit will transition from green to red, purple and finally black.
November to February of next year is the picking time of fruit (the freshness of olive oil is very important).
Nutrients of olive oil:
Olive oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, namely oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and antioxidants.
Olive oil is deemed the most suitable oil for human nutrition among all the oils found so far.
The Summit for Democracy ended, and Biden said the fire of freedom would never extinguish
The online “Summit for Democracy ” held by Biden, the U.S. president, and attended by leaders of governments, civil society and private sector from 110 countries came to a close on Friday (December 10).
Biden said in the closing speech that a dictatorship can never extinguish the flame of liberty that burns in the hearts of people around the world.
He also said that the second global “Summit for Democracy ” was scheduled to be held next year.
Tang Feng, representative of Taiwan government and member of the administrative council, and Luo Guancong, Hong Kong democracy and human rights activist who is currently in exile in the UK, made speeches at the summit on the second day.
Biden said, “We know that we are facing arduous tasks.
But we also know that we can meet the challenges, just as I mentioned before and as what this Summit stands for, the world of democracy is everywhere.
A dictatorship can never extinguish the flame of liberty that burns in the hearts of people around the world. ”
Biden also said that joint efforts from the whole society were required to defend democracy.
He said, “as leaders of governments, we have the responsibility to listen to our citizens, reinforce the guardrail of democracy, promote reforms, realize transparent accountability governance, so as to be better equipped to resist the buffer and impact of dictatorship as well as people who bluntly pursue power in front of public benefits. ”
The themes on the second day of the “Summit for Democracy ” were strengthening human rights, consolidating democracy and fighting against authoritarians, as well as fighting against digital authoritarianism and affirming the values of democracy.
That day happened to be “International Human Rights Day ”.
Guterres, the Secretary General of the United Nations, said in the opening speech on that day that the democracy was facing challenges globally, especially those brought by emerging digital technologies.
He said, “It ’s the time to reiterate the common values, standpoint, as well as the tenacity of democracy.
Social dialogue needs to be deepened to solve the problem of inequality, fight against corruption, update social contracts, invest in high-quality education, and provide more opportunities for women and girls.
This also requires us to condemn populism, nativism and extremism of all forms, including making use of all the tools provided by technical revolutions. ”
Luo Guancong, democracy and human rights activist from Hong Kong, gave a speech at the summit through a pre-recorded video, to remind conferees to continuously pay attention to the human rights situation of Hong Kong and ethnic minorities in China including Uygur ethnic group and the Tibetans.
He said, “For a long time, the world has always accepted the rising of China; however, no mechanism has been established for accountability.
This is the reason why there must be cooperation between politicians and civil society leaders.
We have to ensure that we will use all (the resources) we have to make the renaissance of democracy our primary task. ”
Luo Guancong also called on the free world to unite together and fight against the threats from the Communist Party of China.
He said, “Some of you may be afraid of offend General Secretary Xi Jinping, some of you may not want to lose the Chinese market, and some of you may not realize the threat (of the Communist Party of China) to our democratic values.
And this is the reason why we failed.
This is also the reason why we must make changes. ”
When attending the round table discussion on “Striking digital authoritarianism and affirming the value of democracy ”, Tang Feng, member of the administrative council of Taiwan, issued Country Declaration with a video to emphasize that Taiwan is on the forefront of fighting against dictatorship and authoritarianism.
He also shared experience on how to fight against COVID - 19 epidemic with transparent information and the construction of mutual trust.
He said, “As democracy in Taiwan is still making progress, we shall always stand on the forefront of fighting against the authoritarianism of the whole world, and shall play the leading role in promoting global freedom, democracy and human rights.
During the epidemic, authoritarian governments from all over the world rationalize human rights violations in the name of public health and collective interests, leading to retrogress in global democracy.
However, in Taiwan, we can control the epidemic without putting cities on lockdown, and we can defeat false information without removing it. ”
On the second day of the “Summit for Democracy ”, Treasury Department of United States announced it would implement legal sanctions on 15 individuals and 10 entities in several countries including China and North Korea which were identified as having severely infringed on human rights; at the same time, it would implement investment restriction on a Chinese company which was identified as assisting in infringing on human rights by utilizing surveillance techniques.

Hi, the Poached Chicken with Chili Sauce delivered from the restaurant is raw.
I wanted to try tennis, but I was afraid I couldn’t stick with it, so I thought I would just find one at a suitable price to practice with.
It was not friendly; in fact, the price is usually in proportional to the degree of friendliness; if you are not able to distinguish, then expensive ones usually are more friendly than cheaper ones, and the so called “entry-level ” rackets are in fact industrial garbage.
They are low in strength, and there will be too much vibration when the ball hits on it; it cannot withstand hard balls, and even professional cannot handle it.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, we know you can’t learn to play it, and we know you're not willing to buy expensive ones, so we make a cheap one to fool you; you won't play it again after using it once or twice; since the racket is cheap, you don't feel it's a waste.
If you can tell the difference, it means you have made improvement; then you can come here to buy the expensive ones and I will make money twice.
I recommend you to spend the same amount of money on a better-quality second hand racket such as prince or DUNLOP; these two brands are not famous, and so even if they are good, they are not expensive; you can get a new one with 500 or 600 yuan and a second hand one with 200 yuan; isn’t it nice to have a thousand yuan racket with only so little money?
It ’s friendly to newbies, but once you passed that stage, it will become not so useful; but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the newbie stage.

Actually, there are many tricks for slightly overweight girls to match their clothes.
Slightly overweight girls shall wear skirts not too long or too short; they shall be of the length at around the knees, just covering the fat part of the thighs.
The fat thighs will be shown if the skirt is too short.
Skirts that are too long will make you look short and fat.
If you are dressed in three sections, upper, middle and lower, you will naturally look taller; that is, use different colors for upper body, skirt and stockings, and you will look taller and slimmer.
In fact, a lot of darker color clothes are what slightly overweight girls all have, which the author deeply agrees; dark colors are good methods to cover fatness of your bodies; in addition, noble and elegant black short shirts are best choices for slightly overweight girls.
You will look slimmer in dark clothes, especially black short skirts.
Wear stockings and low-key shoes if your calves are fat.
The more common the better; the color shouldn’t be too bright.
In case people will notice your legs and feet and think you ’re fat.
Slightly overweight girls shall master the tricks for clothing matching.
Slightly overweight girls shall never wear close-fitting short skirts and the upper outer garment shall not be too short or tucked inside the skirt, which seem strange; slightly overweight girls with thicker legs shall wear black stockings or mesh stockings (thin meshes), a flare skirt with print pattern and soft texture, and a loose-collar upper outer garment to cover the defects of the body.
Of course, there are some skills for slightly overweight girls to wear short skirts.
When slightly overweight girls wear short skirts, they shall choose upper outer garment with the same color as the short skirt, so as to make them look taller.
Wearing skirt with a pair of high heels will make your legs seem slimmer and longer, which is the most fashionable outfit in summer!
Girls with fat upper body and slim legs shall choose short dress of luxurious style.
It can not only cover the fat stomach, but also show your advantages.
A-line skirt makes people seem slimmer and is suitable for fat girls; it ’s better to choose tight-fitting upper outer garment so as to form a sense of layers and make you look slimmer.
Fat girls can also try simple white T-shirt with short skirt.
Slightly overweight girls can be fashionable.
Slightly overweight girls can be the focus of attention as long as they master the clothing matching rules.
In addition to changes in matching outfits, slightly overweight girls need to do more exercises, and hopefully you will remove the label of slightly overweight girls sooner 😄

Girl raises donations for elder sister by acting a target, saying “It ’s ok since they are only flesh wounds ” - Xinhuanet
A girl stood in front of a big plank, which writes “human target, 10 yuan for each arrow ” at Wulin Square in Hangzhou.
Yesterday morning, a picture of “a girl in Hangzhou raises donation for her elder sister by acting as a target ” went viral all over WeChat.
A picture shows a girl standing in front of a plank slightly higher than a person, which writes “human target, 10 yuan for each arrow ” at Wulin Square in Hangzhou, indicating that people can shoot with a bow and arrows after making the payment.
The behavior was discussed heatedly by people on the Internet.
Yesterday night, the person in charge of publicity at Xiacheng sub-bureau of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the journalist of the Beijing News that it was confirmed by the police that the girl did this in order to raise donations for her elder sister; however, this behavior should not be advocated, and the girl left from the local police station yesterday after being warned.
The girl who raised donations by acting as a target on the street was warned
In the picture appeared on the Internet, a girl with long hair was standing with her arms spread out in front of a big plank which writes human target, 10 yuan for each arrow ” in black ink at Wulin Square in Hangzhou, and there was another plank in front of her which has the bank account, WeChat account and Alipay account on it.
The picture was discussed heatedly after it was posted on the Internet.
According to some netizens, this behavior is “begging behavior which aims to grab attention ”, but many others show sympathy to her.
“We found her at about 10: 00 am on the 23rd when we went on the patrol around the square, and there were already lots of onlookers. ”
According to what the police officer of the Tianshui Police Station near the site told the local media, there were two young and beautiful girls in early 20s who set up a stall.
The girl acting as the “human target ” kept crying, begging onlookers to play this game; the other girl was calling for attention on the side, saying that the elder sister of her friend suffered from leukemia and is in urgent need of operation fee, and asking onlookers to help her friend.
“We have gained contact with the police in Guizhou and learned that the girl was raising donations for her elder sister who suffered from leukemia. ”
Yesterday night, the person in charge of publicity at Xiacheng sub-bureau of Hangzhou Public Security Bureau confirmed to the journalist of the Beijing News that this girl is named Ji Jiali, and she was raising donations for Ji Jiayan, her elder sister.
Since more than 300 thousand yuan was still required for treatment, Ji Jiali did this because she had no better way.
He told the journalist that one of the two girls acted as human target, and the other girl acted as an assistant and was not involved; nobody was found to have shot arrows during the whole process, and some onlookers only took pictures and posted them on Weibo.
Later, the police sent it to the public security department and identified that the bows and arrows used were not under control.
According to the person in charge, “raising donations by grabbing attention is not advocated ”.
She left from the police station after being warned by the police.

The function is stable, and the heat dissipation of the four air outlets has no problem; it is worth recommending.

What is the hottest thing in 2021?
It was none other than the Tokyo Olympics.
Do you think only Olympic athletes can win awards?
Recently, there is an article titled Look! An article titled Olympic Disciplines in Which Project Managers Can Win Gold Medals was viral, and it mentioned that project managers can be the foremost and unmatched in many disciplines, such as working arduously, going on business trips, and staying up late, the everyday work of project manager, and handling emergency, taking the blame and apologizing are nothing difficult at all.
A seemingly joking article also tells the bitterness of their daily work, and the hidden message is their insufficient energy to handle the current project management work.
People engaged in project management also gradually choose to get rid of the predicament in work by taking certain actions.
Judging from the increasing number of PMP (internationally certified project management professional qualification) applicants each year, increasing project management practitioners improve their project management ability through learning.
According to the 20 - year Development Report on China ’s Project Management (1999 - 2019), as of September 2019, the national PMP ® applicants totals 600,000, with 420,000 passed the PMP ® certification, and the number of valid certificate holders are about 300,000, accounting for 31.2% of the total number of certificates of PMP ® in the world.
In the past ten years, the number of people holding PMP certificates keeps increasing, which indicates that more and more project managers realize it is no longer advisable to do things by simply copying “past experience ”; the rapidly changing working environment tells us that we should learn to stand on the shoulders of scientific giants and explore the way forward.
However, can you ensure the smooth proceeding of project management work after passing the PMP test?
Many beginners of project management say that by learning courses of PMP / IPMP, they can systematically master knowledge points such as the ten fields and five major process groups of project management, but they are still confused when they are actually engaged in project management work.
Many project managers often reflect the following problems: project management awareness is not sufficient, relying solely on personal experience, and there is only project management theories and no ideas about how to practice them; lack of support of systematic project management process and system, unable to actually implement the work, inaccurate project estimation, poor sensitivity of control, and project being delayed again and again; the members ’ division of labor is not clear, there ’s no way to handle the “sophisticated ones ” in the team, communication is not smooth between departments, and it is difficult to push the project forward...
Therefore, ZTCHINA, which has been focusing on the field of product innovation and R & D of management for more than ten years and helped many excellent enterprises cultivate a large number of key R & D talents such as product managers and project managers, and won the honorary title of “China Enterprise R & D and Management Talents Training Demonstration Base ”, presents the online course R & D Project Manager Special Training Camp.
The online course R & D Project Manager Special Training Camp is an online fragmented learning method, which combines the practical cases, tools and methods of many research and development type enterprises to help you master the necessary knowledge and standard actions of project managers, and embark on the advancing journey of project management on your own.
This is also an opportunity for enterprises to promote the training process of project managers and bring efficient operation results to enterprises with less cost and investment.
That ’s all my own introduction, and you may see how other students evaluate this course: This course is not only a professional explanation of the course content in simple terms by the ZTCHINA expert team (former Huawei R & D management team), combining international advanced project management methodology and real business scenarios of many well-known enterprises.
It also provides scientific and practical management tools and methods as well as rich template forms to help students transform and apply the content into specific work after class.

Home Credit advocated rational consumption to consumers before the “Double Twelve ” sale - Economic Observer - a professional financial news website
During the “Double Eleven ” festival this year, the amount of national online payment business transaction reached 1.77 trillion yuan, creating a new high when compared with that of previous years.
Various kinds of coupons and the eye-catching live-streaming sales once again make consumers feel they ’ve gained benefits; this spending spree makes people feel amazed at the increasingly strong spending power of citizens; on the other hand, people need to calm down and think about the influences of consumerism on society and modern mainstream consumer groups.
Before the “Double Twelve ” sale, Home Credit B.V. (hereinafter referred to as“ Home Credit ”) advocated rational consumption, reminding its users, especially young users, to develop good consumption awareness and habits, and reject blind and excessive consumption.
According to the Report of Survey Analysis on Financial Literacy of Consumers published by People ’s Bank of China this year, the financial literacy index of national consumers is 66.81, increased by 2.04 compared with that of 2019.
Generally speaking, citizens in our country have good performance on financial consumption; however, there are big differences in various aspects of financial behaviors and skills, and further improvement of popularization of basic financial knowledge shall be made.
Level of financial literacy of senior citizens and young people is relatively low, and they will still be the key objects of financial education; according to the Report on Debt Status of Chinese Young People issued by Nelson and the Report of Consumption of Chinese Young People from 2019 to 2020 issued by CTV Finance, the younger generation has huge consumption potential, and credit consumption has become an important means of consumption upgrading; 86.6% of young people are using credit products, and nearly half of them have no debt buildup; although there is a relatively rational consumption trend among the younger generation, which is drastically different from the label of “excessive squander ” put on them by society, some young people indeed are involved in excessive consumption and consumption by following the trend, leading to excessive financial pressure and debt risks, and even resulting in increasing social problems; financial enterprises shall shoulder their social responsibilities and guide young consumers in a positive way.
As a licensed consumer finance institution, Home Credit has always been engaged in helping citizens construct their own happy lives with high-quality and thoughtful services, advocating consumers to establish correct consumption view, and actively responding to the call of the supervision units so as to improve the rational consumption awareness of consumers, especially young consumers, with practical actions.
In the past years, Home Credit has been holding comprehensive and diversified financial knowledge popularization activities aiming at young people, including university students; in addition, it has unconsciously offered reasonable guidance on the consumption demands of young groups by means such as cooperating with top universities in the country to host innovative practice competitions, so as to help students establish rational consumption concept and plan for consumption demands reasonably, and to assist them in accumulating life fortunes.
Upon the arriving of the “Double Twelve ” sale, Home Credit reminds all consumers to establish rational consumption awareness and correct concept of money, resist blind and excessive consumption, and avoid forming misunderstanding of loan for consumption, in case it will impact personal credit investigation and economic life in the future.
Be sure to plan in advance when making consumption, live beneath your means, and make repayment as schedule.
If it ’s overdue, related overdue behavior will be recorded in personal credit report, which may lead to adverse influences on economic life such as buying a car or a house in the future.
At the same time, when enjoying financial products and services, be sure to choose authorized institutions and channels and check if related institutions have the qualification for operation.
In the future, Home Credit will continue to provide consumers with diversified services fitting their demands with mature and reliable consumption finance systems and constantly upgraded financial products, so as to improve the public ’s financial knowledge level and help consumers develop the concepts of rational consumption and taking out loans in moderation, and be a consumption finance partner which consumers can trust for a lifetime.

Vietnamese People ’s Daily Website - Gulf Cooperation Council tackle common challenges
The locations where Mohammed Bin Salman, the Saudi Arabia ’s prince stayed include Oman, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait.
It ’s worth noting that it was the first time for Mohammed to visit Qatar since Saudi Arabia and the Arabian alliances imposed an embargo on Qatar in the middle of the year 2017 and led to the Gulf Diplomatic Crisis.
In this crisis, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt severed the diplomatic relations with Qatar and implemented a full embargo; they blamed Qatar for supporting terrorist organizations and keeping close relations with Iran.
Diplomatic tensions had a serious impact on the internal unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council, exerting a negative influence on economy of the countries and regions in that region.
The four Arabian countries blocked the land, sea and air routes to Qatar.
The crisis was only solved at the Gulf Cooperation Council Summit in January, 2021, when the gulf countries signed an agreement for “unity and stabilization ” with the mediation by the U.S. and Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia has reopened its boundary with Qatar.
Saudi Arabia and Egypt are taking the lead in recovering the relations with Qatar by appointing new ambassadors in Qatar.
Arab countries in the gulf aimed to resolve divergence; and restoring relations with Qatar originates from the need to unite for the interests of all countries and regional stability, so as to cope with common challenges.
During the period when the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia visited Oman, both parties agreed to open the first direct land road passage between the two neighboring countries in the gulf.
A passage of 725km connecting the two countries will provide convenience for the travel of citizens and integration of the supply chain of the two countries.
The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will invest 5 billion USD in Oman, and enterprises of the two countries have signed 13 memorandums of understanding of cooperation worth 30 billion USD.
The travel of the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to gulf countries happened as the negotiation was ongoing between Iran and major countries about saving a nuclear deal named Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), an agreement condemned by the Arab Gulf countries as it ’s believed it cannot solve the missile issue with Iran.
All gulf countries have always regarded Iran as the long-term “competitor ” and regarded the nuclear program of Iran as a“ threat ” to regional security.
According to the gulf countries, it is defective not to solve the problem of the guided missiles of Iran or not to take actions to curb the activities of Iran in this region.
Under the backdrop where the nuclear negotiation between major countries and Iran was not able to meet the demand of the gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Iran conducted a direct negotiation.
The objective was to restrain the upgrading of the tense situations in this region.
This is one of the factors that slow down the economic growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries.
The summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council to be held soon will be the first summit for countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council since the end of the dispute between some member countries and Qatar.
This is the opportunity for the Gulf Cooperation Council to reassess the diplomatic achievements that have contributed to the restoration of the unity of the Gulf Cooperation Council; at the same time, various measures are being proposed to make the member countries cooperate sufficiently, so as to cope with common challenges and make contributions to stabilization and development of the gulf countries.

It is said to have the biggest exhaust noises of all supercars in Xinshan District!
The car that our team brings you now is the dream of many men!
It is Lamborghini ’s flagship supercar and Murcielago ’s next generation model, Aventador LP700 - 4!
It is priced nearly 2 million MYR and pays a road tax of around a dozen thousand each year; it is a four-wheel drive; why is it called LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower; can you image how fast that is?
Forget it, I don’t know, either; data says it takes only 2.9s to accelerate from 0 to 100km / h; when my myvi just reaches 30km / h, it is already at 100km / h, hum.
The low car body, extravagant scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the body and the 6.5 V12 engine transparent under the glass perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
The model doesn’t need much introduction; you can Google it yourself; I have prepared something Google won’t necessarily be able to provide!
It is too eye-catching; people look at it everywhere you go; it is uncomfortable! (It is actually sweet.)
Gas is around RM1 for 1km (the owner wouldn’t even care)
You need to practice the posture of when you get in and out of the car or it may be a little awkward (because you might get stuck halfway and crawl out).
The engine is so loud that you will turn deaf when you get out of the car. (But still, it ’s sweet.)
The car body is too big; it will be narrow for it to park at a normal parking space; you will worry that the neighboring car might hit it while opening the door!
You may get lonely because there is no rivalry on the road (I made it up; it has nothing to do with the car owners, haha.)
Don’t get me wrong; the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
Please contact us if you want to take a video for your car!

A car crash involving tens of millions!
I believe car fans all know Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911; Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also over a million!
Recently, a car crashed into a million-level sports car 911 and a tens-of - millions level super car Chiron in just a few minutes in a foreign country!
It seems from the result that there ’s a reason why it is so expensive!
Let university spirit resonate with spirit of the times - Xinhuanet
University spirit refers to a series of educational philosophy and pursuit of values an university accumulates in its long-term development; it is the soul of the university.
Since ancient times, university spirit is indispensable in the development of politics, economy, culture, technology and society, as well as in the progress of a nation.
Since the establishment of the first real university in the world, universities shoulder unique missions which are different from other social organizations; universities in our country emerged in times of national crisis; its spirit is heavily influenced by traditional culture and the change of times; it advocates the values of “benefiting the world with virtue, and governing the country with integrity ” and the patriotic responsibility of“ building a strong country by studying ”.
At present, with the increasingly prominent trend of informatization and globalization of higher education, competition of education, science and technology, and talent across the world are continuously fiercer; higher education is an important “supply end ”, and the structural reform of higher education is facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges.
Especially, the issuing of the General Plan for Coordinating and Promoting the Construction of the Global Top Universities and the Top Disciplines showcases the confidence and determination of our country in the transformation from a giant of higher education to a strong country of higher education; at the same time, it also puts forward higher and newer demands on development of universities.
How to ascend to the top in the world within a short time, and accelerate the construction of several world-class universities and a batch of world-class disciplines while there is still a gap, and “overtake on a bend ”?
In addition to insisting on objective confidence, path confidence and ability confidence, universities and colleges shall also give full play to three advantages: the first one is the advantage of backwardness; through the continuous introduction of overseas outstanding academic talents and learning from the advanced experience of world-class universities, significantly improve the academic level and school running quality; the second one is the cultural advantage; inheriting the wisdom of the Chinese civilization accumulated for five thousand years and carrying forward excellent traditional culture, unify strength, build brand and improve image; the third one is system advantage; give play to the institutional advantages of socialist countries, strengthen objective driving, collect consensus and joining forces, optimize resource configuration, and provide sustainable and solid support for the university to speed up catching up with and surpassing the world advanced level.
It shall be especially noted that in order to construct world-class universities, the universities shall manifest their uniqueness and their own characteristics at the same time of giving full play to its advantages.
Running an university has to possess the common Chinese characteristics and manifest unique objective positioning, school operation traditions and resource endowment.
For Zhejiang University, three characteristics are emphasized in our operation: the first one is to highlight the special training of innovation and entrepreneurship talents: construct integrated teaching environment by combining science with education and combining schools and enterprises, and the full-chain entrepreneurship education ecological system; the second one is to highlight the feature of cross-discipline convergence: promote the optimization and adjustment of discipline system, build the environment of the cross-discipline system, and actively cultivate results of cross-discipline and emerging discipline research and landmark cross-discipline achievements; the third one is to highlight the school operation system and the social service features: carry out in-depth international exchanges and cooperation, and accelerate forming the industry-university research cooperation system of Zhejiang University.
In this process, it is especially important to always stick to the university spirit, and let it resonate with the spirit of the times.
For Zhejiang University, the university motto of “seeking truth and making innovation ”, the common values of“ study diligently, cultivate morality, foster discernment, advocate honesty ” and the principles of “harboring generosity like the ocean, seeking the truth while upholding morality, being brave enough to keep exploring, and building our country ” constitute the newest expression system of the spirit of Zhejiang University.
The university insists on the correct direction of running an university, continuously accumulates the altitude of culture and the important support by condensing the power of spirit; it has profound connotations and far-reaching significance.
In which, “harboring generosity like the ocean ” emphasizes the spirit of inclusiveness, reflecting the mindset of“ inviting all talents ”, which is manifested as absorbing the premium concepts of university operation and talent training of world famous universities; “seeking the truth while upholding morality ” lays emphasis on the spirit of the pursuit for truth and kindheartedness, meaning that universities shall accept the cultivation of virtue and the tempering of personality while pursuing for truth;“ being brave enough to keep exploring ” reflects the spirit of reform and innovation, including innovation in knowledge and science and technology, as well as reform, development and innovation; “building our country ” stresses the spirit of patriotism and dedication, meaning that universities shall always share the glory and disgrace with the destiny of the country.
These spiritual ethos and the pursuit of values are the soul of Zhejiang University in its 120 years of university running.
“Wise people can hear when there is only silence and see before things are formed. ”
Universities and colleges in China shall further master the direction of the times and the historical mission of higher education based on the overall situation of the socialism with Chinese characteristics, and accelerate the construction of top universities in the world.
At the same time, hold fast to humanistic care, independence and freedom, to make university spirit, spirit of the times and national spirit promote each other, so as to provide infinite power for realizing state prosperity, national rejuvenation and the common ideal of all human beings.

As NFT went viral beyond its own circle, a new concept emerged in the encrypted community.
In 2021, a blockchain game called Axie Infinity has exerted a huge impact in Southeast Asia, and some residents who lost their jobs due to the epidemic began to earn stable income in this game.
Axie Infinity is a pet grooming game based on blockchain technology, which integrates a variety of playing methods including NFT, and it is the NFT project with the highest trading volume now, exceeding US $3 billion so far.
Data of TokenTerminal shows that the daily income of Axie Infinity exceeds 8.2 million US dollars, approaching that of Honor of Kings.

I read a piece of news about one of my friends ’ stock price, and my biggest feeling is the how the enterprise chooses its track, that is, the choice of the investment target industry; first of all, they should choose a industry with a large space for development and a market size of at least 100 billion; secondly, we should choose industries with good growth in the future and consider the industries with the best growth in the next 3 - 5 years; finally, choose industries with policy support.
The width of the track refers to the scale of market, the length of the track refers to the development stage of the industry, and whether the track is easy or bumpy refers to the competitiveness landscape of the industry.
Cheer for the right track!
In the new year, the first task is to summarize 2021 and adjust the tactical layout of 2022.
The key of the tactics is “do the things right ”.
The key of the strategy is “do the right thing ”.
Strategy lies in finding direction and tactics lies in implementation; above most tactical thinking, there is room for strategic thinking.
For example, on top of how to increase the number of customers (tactical thinking), we can think about whether to continuously deepen the current field or expand the horizontal field (strategic thinking); for example, on top of improving customer retention rate (tactical thinking), we can think about how to improve the retention of core customers and high-value customers (strategic thinking); on top of improving activity participation (tactical thinking), we can consider how to set the correct activity KPIs to achieve the correct activity goals, such as improving the participation of target customers, activating high-value silent customers, and accurately attracting new customers; on top of improving DAU (tactical thinking), we can consider whether the current growth is healthy and sustainable.
After coming into being 12 years ago, bitcoins ushered in several milestone events in 2021.
On September 7, the small country, El Salvador, in Central America designated bitcoins as a legal tender, and this is the first time that bitcoin has become the legal tender of a country or region.

From the perspective of blockchain technology, bitcoin is not the leading role.

Asian communities in the US complains about admission discrimination by Yale and two other Ivy League universities - Xinhuanet
Message from Xinhua News Agency Washington on May 23 (journalist: Xu Jianmei): More than 130 Asian communities in the US submitted a complaint to the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice in the US on May 23 to protest against the discrimination on Asian students in the enrollment of 3 Ivy League universities, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.
Asian American Coalition for Education, who initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on that day.
According to the speech made by Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, during the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission qualification of famous universities in the US has doubled and redoubled; however, in these famous universities in the US, the proportion of Asian students basically maintained at the same level.
According to lots of research results, these universities “discriminated against Asian students in a long-term, continuous and systematic way ” during the so-called“ comprehensive consideration ” of the admission process.
As introduced by Zhao Yukong, according to research results of scholars such as Saunders in 2014, in these 3 universities, Asian students have the lowest acceptance rate among all the ethnic groups considering the number of applicants.
Data from Department of Education of the US also indicates that among all the Ivy League Universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate of Asian students; Yale University and Brown University have been implementing racial quota of Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told the journalist of Xinhua News Agency that they wished that Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice of the US could conduct investigation after they submitted the complaint, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in the admission process after identifying the facts.
They also wished that the universities being complained about could pay attention to this issue on their own initiative and change the recruitment policy for Asian students.
The 3 universities being complained about have not responded yet.
Established in 2015, Asian American Coalition for Education once made a complaint against Harvard University about admission discrimination, but the US Ministry of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds.
In addition to Asian groups in the US, the groups involved in the complaint also include Indian, Korean, Japanese Americans and Pakistani education groups in the US.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a plant located at Yuyao Zhangting Village in Zhejiang through an estate agent and decided to purchase it after seeing it on-site for a few times.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, a family member of the house owner, about the details of the purchase of the plant, and remitted 200,000 yuan as a deposit by bank transfer on the same day.
Lin signed as the payee on the Receipt of the Deposit for the Purchase and Sale of the Plant, which stated that if the buyer does not to buy the plant, the deposit belongs to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned to the seller in double; both parties agree to sign the plant purchase and sale contract within one week. ”
However, both parties failed to reach an agreement on the main items in the contract including the scope of the sale of the plant and method of payment, and as a result, they were delaying the signing of the plant purchase and sale contract.
Considering they have not reached an agreement on the content of the contract, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 to Mr. Lu a few days later.
Mr. Lu was helpless and angry because he had a hard time finding the plant, paid the deposit, prepared the payment and was waiting for the contract to be signed, but the seller didn’t want to sell it anymore.
For this, Mr. Lu decided to sue Lin at the Yuyao People ’s Court.
After the hearing, the court held that the two parties failing to sign a formal contract could not be attributed only to the defendant, but should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed; therefore, the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant should not bear the liability for breach of contract and return twice the deposit.
After the judgment of the first instance, the plaintiff appealed again.
Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.
[Reminder from attorney] In the process of trading, we should perform necessary duty of prudence.
When signing the contract, the buyer should perform necessary duty of prudence, such as verifying the information of the house owner and whether the house is occupied, and specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract, so as to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese Website) After the “Democracy Summit ” on Friday, the spokesperson of Foreign Ministry of China delivered a speech on Saturday (December 11), stating that the United States hosting the“ Leaders ’ Democracy Summit ” to “make democracy tool-oriented and weapon-oriented based on ideology, to implement anti-democracy in the name of democracy, so as to incite division and confrontation and to shift domestic contradictions ”.
According to the Government of China, “for a very long time, the U.S. has been imposing its own political systems and values on others, carried out ‘ democratic transformation’, used unilateral sanction indiscriminately and has instigated ‘ Color Revolution’, leading to disastrous consequences.
“Democracy has long become the weapon of mass destruction the United States used to interfere with other countries.
The summit was the action that Biden took to fulfill his promise made during the campaign.
The meetings during the 2 - days summit were held via video call, and leaders from 111 countries were invited to attend the meeting, including the leaders of Taiwan; however, leaders of China and Russia were not invited.
China and Russia attacked the U.S. for what was wrong with its own democracy before the summit, and said that the U.S. did not have the qualification to hold such a summit.
There were doubts internationally and in the U.S.; for example, the U.S. was criticized for inviting leaders who had the tendency to be authoritarians, such as the leaders of the Philippines, Poland and Brazil, and some suspected that the real intention of the Biden government was geopolitics, not democracy.
German Chancellor Scholz who just took office also attended the video Democracy Summit.
According to the statement made by Chinese Foreign Ministry on Saturday, “the American democracy today is morbid, with increasingly obvious problems such as money politics, identity politics, political opposition, political polarization, social tearing, racial conflicts and polarization of the rich and the poor ”, and the democracy of the U.S. was the“ game of the rich ” established based on the capital.
The U.S. President, Biden, expressed in his speech, “as the leaders of the government, we have the responsibility to listen to ideas of our citizens, reinforce the guardrail of democracy, promote reforms and realize transparent accountability and governance, to fight against the power of impact of buffer of autocracy and those who bluntly pursue power before public benefits. ”
He emphasized that democracy should not be taken for granted, “we must keep update it in every generations which is, in my opinion, the decisive challenge of our era. ”
Biden also said that global democracy and human rights are “facing continuous and worrying challenges, and democracy should be guarded by fighters ”.
The United States promised that after this Democracy Summit, it will carry out a series of year-long actions including a 424.4 million USD initiative to strengthen democracy around the globe and provide support to independent new media.
The U.S. wants all countries to make specific and open promises before the democratic summit held at the end of 2022, so as to improve the democratic system.
Biden said, “let ’s all fulfill our promises and report our progresses next year ”.
OK, I just worry that he will deliver it to the wrong address.

It is mellow and fresh in the mouth, with a slight taste of vanilla and strong smoked malt.
The wine can be drunk directly with ice or mixed with your favorite drinks.
After Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky entered China, in order to adapt to the tastes of Chinese people, drinking Red Label whisky with bubble beverage such as Cola, Sprite or Sunkist has become an enduring fashion.
These sweet drinks not only can neutralize the sour taste, bring pleasure to people visually, but also can dilute the taste of wine and change the overall taste.
Red Label whisky + sliced lemon + cube sugar (granulated sugar is also acceptable) is the most authentic and traditional drinking method.
Authentic Red Label whisky tastes a little sour; adding sugar can neutralize the sour taste, lemon will bring fresh fragrance to the wine, and of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal tastes.

Thought on Education: How do examinations in college allow straight A students and slack students both get what they deserve - Xinhuanet
Three students in Lanzhou Jiaotong University wrote a letter to leaders of the university to reflect their confusion on examinations in university, and raised the ideas to increase the difficulty of examinations, change types of questions and let the examinations reflect the real learning level of students.
Indeed, examinations in universities have been a “heated topic“ for a long time.
Students on campus come from all corners of the country, with varied abilities and levels; due to different efforts spent in study, their situations of study vary significantly.
It is inevitable for different feelings about the examinations to exist in such a diversified group.
Certainly, it will cause a completely different experience if there are few types of questions, the questions are repetitive or too simple.
Students who do not study hard can pass the exam after cramming before the exam; if they think of other ways, they may half the work with double results.
As such, there will be a “strange phenomenon where“ slack students ” who don’t ordinarily study pass the exam and even getting high scores; “straight A ” students who never miss any class, take notes, do assignments get scores that are not much higher.
In this way, the problems in college exams reflected by students of Lanzhou Jiaotong University are not groundless; it is believed that such situations do not exist only in Lanzhou Jiaotong University.
In this sense, we should applaud for the three students who wrote the letter to reflect the problem directly.
In fact, people who have been to colleges know that the phenomena of cramming for an exam, “trying to winkle ” exam questions from teachers, trying to get the scope of the questions and acquiring“ key tutoring ” before exam are not rare; further, bringing notes to exams or begging teachers to give higher marks after exams are not rare, either.
In the view of the author, as a guidance for teaching quality evaluation, judging if the exams in a college are qualified or not relies more on the comprehensive mastering on teaching and learning by teachers, as well as the setting questions scientifically on this basis.
Majors are segmented after entering the undergraduate study, and many specialized courses are carried out with basic knowledge as the main content.
Undoubtedly, whether the students have mastered the basic knowledge is a content to be inspected in the exams in college.
Knowledge during the undergraduate study is mainly basic theories and common sense of the subject, and in terms of knowledge points, they are basically unchanged and there is not much room for variation.
As some teachers have said, “the mathematical basic knowledge in college twenty years ago is still being taught today and it is still a key content. ”
However, the unchanging basic knowledge points do not mean there can be single type or repetitive questions.
There will usually be a group working on setting test questions for the exams, and senior teachers of the subject will coordinate and compile a test paper; marking test papers will be undertaken by all teachers of the subject; this can in a sense overcome the situation of repetitive questions.
In order to prepare a set of test questions in accordance with practical conditions of teaching and learning, it is necessary to set questions with normal distribution in difficulty degree according to general learning conditions of students; it is also required to learn about the teaching situation, comprehensively analyze how well the students have learned so as to have a good command of the level of difficulty and type of question in designing the test paper, giving priority to inspection of basic knowledge, and testing their ability at the same time; creative designs on the type of question can be made as well.
College exam is the baton of college education, and students prepare for college exam according to the exam types; for this reason, college exams will influence the effect of college education in the long run.
Lanzhou Jiaotong University pays special attention to the letter of advise from the students; it has deployed the scheme for rectification in the university.
It requires all teaching units to organize teachers to deliberate and conduct self-inspection on exams at the end of a course, formulate systems about question setting for exam paper, strengthen supervision and inspection on question setting and review, specify grade evaluation work, and strengthen comprehensive inspection on various links of course teaching.
Solving problems such as types of questions are few and repetitive questions by way of changing the system is a task that college exam administration needs to deal with; regulations need to be issued, but efforts should be made in normal times; it requires teachers to comprehensive master the teaching and learning situation; they need to not only master their teaching content but also the learning situation of the students; mastering both can better connect teaching and learning, forming an effective interaction; exams will be more fit for the actual situation, and straight A students and slack students can both get what they deserve.
If you cannot change the location of the branch store for me, can I change it to delivery?
Then I don’t need to pay again, right?
My colleague has delivered all the orders.
I can’t pull it to complete.
Where is GPS? Has it arrived yet?
Mrs. Gold Wedding Dress Photography (Nanjie Store) has no branch store yet.
Because I didn’t arrange my time well before the shoot, I rescheduled twice and consultant Lanlan patiently arranged time for us.
Later we chose a weekend with nice weather to shoot it.
The staff at Mrs. Gold, no matter it ’s consultant or makeup artist, are fantastic.
That was the first time that I had officially put on makeup and wow, I couldn’t even believe that I could be so pretty one day, haha.
Xiaojie and the other girl (sorry, I forgot her name) were super patient while doing my makeup and the makeup was natural.
We shot the outdoor scene at Jiangwancheng, and fortunately the weather was nice that day, we didn’t feel cold; during the shoot, makeup artist was paying attention to our clothes, headwear, and made adjustment immediately once there was a problem.
The photographer was funny, and we were happy throughout the day.
When choosing the photos, I saw many cases online where they wouldn’t let the customers delete too many photos, but they didn’t ask us to add photos at all, just the 24 photos in the set and nothing more (I heard that my cousin who was also taking wedding dress photos added photos worth over 10,000 in addition to the 7,000 yuan set, and I was stunned and feared I might choose too many).
The editing was finished today and Lanlan sent it to me; I felt two were not good enough and they immediately re-edited them for me.
I found the old photos of my sister to make comparison, and I felt that our photos were really satisfying, simple and fresh, exactly what I wanted.
I sincerely recommend choosing Xuanhan Mrs. Gold to take your wedding dress photoshoot!
Set price: 3,999 yuan
Mrs. Gold is grateful for you and sincerely wishes you a happy life and a promising future!
How much is this set?
Then what are the conditions for using the $32 one?
That ’s fine, and there is no need to refund it.
Your delivery person said it couldn’t be found.
Can’t find it.
But I don’t understand his English.

3200 new infants in Sabah have no birth certificates because of the supply shortage of the specially made security paper.
(Kota Kinabalu News on the 11th) According to the National Registration Bureau of Sabah, new infants cannot be provided with birth certificates from the beginning of October due to supply shortage of the specially made security paper; a total of 3,200 infants have been influenced so far.
However, director of the bureau, Kerouaminus, promised that the data of all the infants applying for birth certificate has been recorded in the system, and the certificates will be issued as soon as the security paper arrives next week.
He made the explanation at the press conference regarding to an online media ’s report that the paper shortage of birth certificates in Sabah has been going on for ten months.
He said that related problems started 2 months ago, and that Sarawak is also facing this problem.
“One of the reasons is that the manufacturers of the security paper in China are influenced by the epidemic, leading to a delay in delivery to our country. ”
He explained that the security paper used for birth certificates in Sabah is different from that of other regions, and therefore stock in other regions cannot be borrowed.
Kerouaminus disclosed that the latest batch of security paper has been delivered to Kuala Lumpur on December 6, and was handed over to the printing company on December 8 for part of the printing work.
“The National Registration Bureau of Sabah will dispatch staffs to pick up the goods in Kuala Lumpur next Thursday to complete the printing of the last stage after returning to Sabah, and it is estimated that they can be given out to the applicants at most 2 working days later (December 20). ”
“We ’ll notify the applicants to get the birth certificates at their local branch bureau. ”

Negative nucleic acid test result within 48 hours and setting up a "buffer zone", the State Council joint prevention and control mechanism issued a document to strengthen epidemic prevention and control in port cities - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency Beijing December 11th (Reporters Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) State Council joint prevention and control mechanism recently issued a notice about strengthening epidemic prevention and control of COVID - 19 in port cities, asking people who recently left land border port cities (except those connected with ports of Hong Kong and Macao) to hold the negative result of nucleic acid test within 48 hours, and people who go to the land border port cities should take the nucleic acid test at least once after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range of the aforementioned request is from the date when the province, autonomous region and city determine the scope of port cities and announce it until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also requests that port cities with the capability can study the possibility of setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zone within their jurisdiction.
According to the introduction of the person in charge of the Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main local economic pillar and the border residents from both sides have frequent exchanges.
The implementation of the policy of zoning and differentiated management is to make one defense line of the spread of prevention and control into two lines, make it possible to move the gateway forward, reduce the risk of the spread of the epidemic, and to achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and social cost.
Recently, there have been many local cluster outbreaks of diagnosed cases in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities.
The notice points out that this has exposed some problems, such as the untimely monitoring and warning of epidemic in some places, the non-existing implementation of closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, regular nucleic acid testing becoming a mere formality, the inadequate disinfection and sterilization of cold-chain items in all links, the non-standard management of centralized quarantine sites, and the unscientific and inaccurate emergency response of epidemic situation.
The notice requests that efforts should be made in nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system and implementing border control measures, to speed up the improvement of the weak links in the prevention and control of port cities, deliver the prevention and control work scientifically, accurately and without relaxing, as well as to strengthen the defense line of curbing imported cases.
The notice stresses that all port cities should study and deploy the epidemic prevention and control and safeguard people's livelihood at the same time, publish and monitor the smooth running of the people's livelihood hotline, regularly check the potential dangers in the supply and price of basic life necessities, and timely solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the port cities mentioned include counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (areas, prefectures, leagues) and municipalities directly under the central government where the open land, water and air ports are located, and specific scope shall be determined and timely announced by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government) according to the demand of epidemic prevention and control.

YouTube video uncovers the truth of US army ’s bloodthirsty killing of 20 years - Xinhuanet
(source of video: YouTube)
On December 11, a short documentary named Killing Machine went viral on YouTube.
The documentary tells of various kinds of antihuman crimes committed by the US, including launching the war against Afghanistan in the name of “anti-terrorism ”, outputting American democracy forcefully via wars, exhausting its resources to build up its military power, being obsessive about bloodthirsty killing, and massacring the innocent at will for 20 years.
The US army launched air strikes to civil places such as hospitals and schools by abusing UAV, and established killing squad with distorting human nature.
The US army has killed dozens of thousands of innocent Afghanistan civilians for 20 years.
The US army set up “black prison ” to apply various cruel tortures and personal humiliation to“ suspects ”.
Countless antihuman crimes stirred up hatred from even more Afghan civilians.
Just as what the video says, American anti-terrorism war “is creating more terrorism ”.
The war did not bring peacefulness, democracy, prosperity or hope to Afghan people; instead, they threw the country in a state of devastation and countless killing and destruction.
Let us click on the video and reveal the truth of bloodthirsty killing in the name of “anti-terrorism ” of the US, and rip off the false mask of American democracy!
I came across the following article, which talks about why this customer wants the logistics company in the bonded area to help with canning from the perspective of business and shelf life; although canning is deep processing and is not within the business scope of the bonded logistics company, the following text perhaps can explain why the customer wants to do this.
I have visited many milk powder manufacturers and gained contact with many production lines of milk powder.
Actually, the raw materials of milk powder in bags and in cans are exactly the same.
Then you may ask: why is the shelf life of milk powder one year in bags and two years or longer in cans?
Or you may ask: why are the prices of bagged and canned milk powder so different?
Actually, from this point of view, many consumers or mothers think that the quality will be much better because the raw materials are different.
Actually, the raw materials are the same, and people just think the goods are more expensive because they are better.
There are also customers in this mindset who say that the taste is indeed different after drinking it!
Now I will introduce why the canned ones are expensive.
Why are the prices so different when the raw materials are the same?
When the manufacturers set the price, they know that if they price too high, it is difficult for the customers to accept and the profits will be very low for the manufacturers or there will be no profit at all; then what will the manufacturers live on?
Therefore, in the price setting of the canned ones, they set it much higher to guarantee their profits.
As a result, many manufacturers recommend canned ones instead of bagged ones.
Just think about where the tens of millions or even hundreds of millions yuan advertising fee of the manufacturers come from every year.
Everyone knows it.
With the development of society, the market promotion expenses kept increasing, such as the cost of promotion personnel at shopping malls, the display expenses of products at shopping malls, the cost of gifts of products, advertising expenses, etc.
Therefore, various manufacturers are also constantly adding new products in can packaging, and the price kept rising as well; in fact, these new product are introduced due to the increase of market costs.
The main objective is to gain more profits; the increased cost of raw materials is actually no more than 3 or 4 yuan.
There are also some brands that, in order to promote their products, cooperate with doctors in the hospital by all means, and ask them to assist in the promotion of products, drawing profits ranging from 30 yuan to 80 yuan from one can.
China ’s relevant laws by no means allow such operations because this practice is in fact harming consumers.
It is recommended that you buy bagged milk powder and put it into cans if you have cans at home, which can save money and increase the preservation time and hermetic seal of milk powder; it won’t have any influence on the children.
Also, don’t think that the shelf life of canned ones is longer than that of bagged ones; the shelf life of canned ones is the same as that of bagged ones after unpacked; it ’s just that bagged ones are not easy to be preserved and are easy to become damp and deteriorate.
The delivery was late, and after the food got cold, it was dry and hard, completely inedible.
Also the soup was spilled.
Cancel it immediately, the stuff he # PRS _ ORG # resends here must be cold.
I didn’t take it!
# NAME # said no one went to pick it up.
We called.
I ’ll call the police if you don’t refund it.
I ’ve used # PRS _ ORG # many times, and today I had the worst experience.
Totally unacceptable.
Okay, fine.
But you need to remind the restaurant and delivery person.
To prevent it from happening again.
I want to know the exact delivery time.
The time kept being put off.
I don’t know how much longer do I have to wait.
If I cancel the order, can I get the money back?
I want to pay service fee to the delivery person, how can I do it?
It was confirmed more than an hour ago that there was a delivery person.
Not willing to wait any longer.
Don’t scare people off at the starting line - Xinhuanet
We can usually feel the popularity of books on success when we go to bookstores.
Many books on success nowadays advocate the “best principle ”, which first assumes or implies that you can“ do it ”, and then tell you “what it is ” that you need to do.
It skips the most important and fundamental link of “how to do it ”.
As such, these books have one common characteristic; you either work to be the best or do nothing at all; you either be 100 or be 0; you either climb on Mount Tai or stay where you are.
The “best principle ” will make every reader believe it is“ absolutely right ”, but 99% of people will be scared off at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a route in which “you have to be resolute to start again and change 180 degrees ”, and this happens to be the weakest point of many people.
Shouting “you need to change ” to people who stick to the rules, follow the old ways, and refuse to change is lying to yourself and casting pearls before swine.
The majority of people will be timid in front of “change ”, reluctant to move forward or make the decision; or, they have made the decision to“ change ” on an impulse and bravely taken the first step, but it doesn’t last long and they will lose courage after persevering for while; they cannot be persistent.
From Tomorrow On, the famous sketch from Mr. Ma Sanli, most vividly depicts the classic of “common humanity ”.
The biggest problem of the “best principle ” is the threshold is too high; it surpasses the limit of the ability of ordinary people and leave most people“ sigh at the beginning ”.
Or, the “second best principle ” perhaps is a route for more ordinary people to be successful.
The core of the “second best principle ” is lowering the threshold; it encourages“ accumulating small successes to have big success ”; even if you cannot reach 100, you can be 1, because 1 is always bigger than 0; if you cannot climb on Mount Tai, you can climb on the small dune in front of your house, because that is still better than marching on the spot.
Anyway, doing anything is better than doing nothing at all.
Due to the dramatic lowering of the threshold, the possibility of ordinary people persevering with it is higher; the success rate will be higher for anything as long as you persevere,
It ’s just that the journey will be longer if you follow the “second best principle ”.
In all, although the “best principle ” on the surface claims to make everyone successful, it will eventually only encourage few people in actuality; the“ second best principle ” can effectively encourage more people and make more people actually gain benefit.
Do I need to re-place the order now?
The phone was not answered.
Kept being delayed.
Still not delivered.
May I ask when it will arrive?
How do I gain contact?
Please cancel the order.
I can’t wait any longer, thanks.
He still has two food orders to deliver, but one order has completed.
I want to know how to contact the delivery person.
The first delivery person told me that another delivery person would send it again.
The reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources in the Qinghai Lake have increased by 7.1 thousand tons - Xinhuanet
Report from Xinhua News Agency Xining on December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) Reporters learned from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons; there is a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with that in the initial stage of protection in 2002.
Gymnocypris przewalskii, commonly known as “scaleless carp ”, is a unique and precious fish species in the Qinghai Lake, which plays an indispensable role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the“ water, fish, bird ” ecological chain in Qinghai Lake Basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of gymnocypris przewalskii has decreased sharply due to the human hunting in vast quantities and the increasingly degraded environment of breeding waters of gymnocypris przewalskii, the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources in Qinghai Lake in 2002 were only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, gymnocypris przewalskii was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.
From 2003, Qinghai province implemented the closure of lakes for fish breeding, prohibited any unit, collective or individual from fishing gymnocypris przewalskii in the main rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and prohibited the sale of gymnocypris przewalskii and their products.
In the meantime, the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources have increased year by year through artificial breeding and releasing, clearing of the main rivers flowing into Qinghai Lake and river courses, designing scientific and reasonable “fish passage ” and other measures to continue to strengthen protection.
Yang Lin, Deputy Director General of Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, introduced that up until now, nearly 180 million gymnocypris przewalskii have been artificially reproduced and released, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of gymnocypris przewalskii resources.
Qinghai three-rivers area is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the eastward spread of desertification in the west.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the three rivers area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued a notice banning fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since this year, and established a comprehensive management system of fishing ban of “one river, one river, and one lake ”.

The restaurant only gave me one bag of it, and it needs to be put in a bag because it ’s cold.
May I ask if the food delivery was put in one bag?
We only see one bag.
I want to know if it was missed or someone took it, thanks.
It has been 1 hour and it still has not been delivered yet.
I just read an article about period, and it ’s too long.
I ’ll introduce to men who don’t know about it.
Most girls will get their first period between 13 to15 years old, and have amenorrhea around 50.
Then they get period regularly once every month on the premise of good health.
But it is not so regular that you can precisely predict it; there is a difference of around a week; you need to prepare early and sometimes you may get unlucky and it arrives several days earlier.
The length of time, blood volume and degree of dysmenorrhea vary from person to person; some people have it for three days and some people a week; some people have small flow and some people have way too much; some people don’t have any reaction, and some people feel so painful that they have to be taken away by the ambulance; dysmenorrhea will change over time, and not having it before doesn’t mean it won’t happen for a lifetime.
You can’t control menstruation; you bleed 24 hours from the beginning to the end, and all you can do is absorb blood with pads or tampons to prevent it from getting onto clothes or chairs.
Dysmenorrhea is mainly due to the secretion of prostaglandins; Taking ibuprofen can effectively relieve the pain of dysmenorrhea that month before menstruation begins, but taking it is useless to after dysmenorrhea begins.
It is easy to have diarrhea before the period due to uterine congestion and excessive prostaglandin release.
If you are near the cycle and you have diarrhea for no reason at all, you will basically get your period within two days.
It is best to replace sanitary pads every two or three hours, otherwise it is easy to breed bacteria; apart from sleep time, the worst case is to replace them six times a day, seven days a month, and that is 42 pieces; if you add the ones prepared in advance, there may be 50 pieces, not just one piece every month.
(a little modification here, tampons do not need to be changed often; it can be changed every five or six hours, up to eight hours)
Hormones during menstruation may make you irritable, and ovulation may also make you emotionally unstable due to hormone changes in the body, which is very troublesome; your body makes itself suffer.
However, you may see from the official crime rate data that women ’s ability to control their emotions is still very high, and they will not make excuses for emotional problems.
It ’s not just blood, but also endometrium that fall off.
After menstruation, the endometrium is the thinnest, and then it gradually thickens; you may think that the uterus is a house; you build a house every month (the endometrium thickens) to prepare for guests, and if the guests do not come, all of them are demolished (menstruation flows out) and a new house is built next month, which starts again and again.
Menstruation is very inconvenient; you bleed 24 hours a few days a month for dozens of years, and it also causes abdominal pain and lower back pain; who would want that?
But people are born because their mother has menstruation; menstruation exists to prepare for the house where you will live for 10 months before you come to this world; everyone should thank their mother for menstruating regularly and healthily.
In the past, many things about women were suppressed; society brainwashed women and told them it ’s dirty and shameful, and everyone thought that it was like that; but times have changed.
If someone feels that menstruation is disgusting, the female body ’s preparation for life is disgusting, and it shouldn’t be said in public; girls, stand up and don’t think this way; men who have never experienced it, won’t experience it in this life, and don’t know much about it, don’t be so ungrateful and unkind; how can you face your mother and children in this attitude?
Finally, sisters, try tampons; they are really easy to use.
Today is the Winter Solstice, and delivering the wrong thing is quite disappointing.
Please place another order for the children.
I hope the store can set aside some time out of its busy schedule to check the quality of the products.
Does it mean there is leakage of electricity if my feet feel numb in the feet bath basin?
Choosing the right feet bath basin can provide good pedicure and healthcare, and today Gome will answer this question; hopefully it will be helpful to you.
As people care more about healthcare, feet bath basin has become more popular among the customers, and a large batch of products of different levels have emerged on the market, from a little more than 100 yuan up to a thousand yuan, giving the customers a lot of options.
According to related statistics, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of healthcare products such as feet bath basin was hot, but there is no specialized industry standard for feet bath basin and so there is potential safety risk.
“Having a feet bath in the water with electricity is too dangerous! ”
Mr. Li told reporter that he recently bought a feet bath basin for his father as a birthday present, but his father felt that the bottom of his feet were numb when using it.
Mr. Li first thought it was caused by the vibration function of the feet bath basin, and it was unexpected that his father still felt his feet were numb after turning off the vibration function.
Mr. Li used a tester and the light on it was on; it was to Mr. Li ’s surprise that the water in the feet bath basin was electrified.
Then he contacted the seller, whose attitude was nice, but Mr. Li still felt upset although he had returned it.
Because he found that feet bath basin, which has been popular for a long time, still has no explicit and detailed industry regulations on the setting of the maximum temperature, suitable crowd, what materials are safe to use, etc.
But normally feet bath basin shouldn’t be electrified, however we can’t rule out the fact that a few products might not have been strictly checked before leaving the factory.
Therefore, choose split type feet bath basin.
There is no safety risk when water and electricity are separated.
Meanwhile, you can use a tester to test it.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo opened - Headline of viewpoints - Hunan Daily - Huasheng Online
Message from Hunan Daily on December 10 (all-media journalists: Zhang Shangwu and Hu Panpan, correspondent: Liu Xiaoling, photographer: Li Jian) The 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Introduction and Marketing Event were held in Hunan International Expo Center this morning to exhibit tea industry, innovate tea science and technology, advocate tea culture and accelerate the process of realizing the industry objective of 100 billion.
Hou Shunli, deputy director of the Council of China National Supply and Marketing Cooperative Head Office, and Ye Hongzhuan, deputy director of the Standing Committee of Provincial People ’s Congress, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced at the opening ceremony: Xinhua is the source of Hunan Black Tea, and the emerging of the black tea injects new energy into the “colorful Hunan tea ”.
In recent years, the provincial Party committee and the provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the Hunan tea industry of 100 billion and formed the development pattern of “three Xiang, four rivers, and five colors of tea ”.
The tea industry of the province has been promoting innovation, and main tea types such as green tea and black tea take turns to generate power; tea-travel integration is promoted in main tea production areas to drive income increase of tea farmers.
Every type of tea takes turns to gain its spotlight, and now it is time for black tea.
According to opinion of experts in the tea industry in the province, tea farmers pick black tea after green tea and have income in all four seasons, making the production value of tea gardens soar.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded plates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the trademark of “Hunan black tea ”, and Xinhua was awarded the title of“ source of Hunan black tea ”.
In the exhibition hall of Xinhua black tea, a tea merchant from Fujian took a fancy to a high mountain tea named “spring in ice ” and placed an order immediately.
Wang Zhun, secretary-general of provincial tea association, said happily that factors such as epidemic exert an impact on the tea market to a certain extent; however, based on the situations at the tea expo, there are various highlights.
The red color of Xinhua black tea has instilled the essence of tea culture, and with its popularity and hot transactions, the Hunan tea industry is ushering in a new spring.

Metaphysics refers to the study of problems that cannot be answered directly through perception, but only through rational reasoning and logic.
Metaphysics is the basic law of philosophy, which aims to explain the fundamental nature of existence and the world.
The Chinese translation of Metaphysics originates from “the metaphysical is the Tao, and the physical is vessel ” in the Book of Changes, Texts of Hexagrams, and was translated from metaphysic by Japanese Kajiro Inoue (Meiji era).
The branches of metaphysics include ontology, natural theology and its extended questions.
Ontology is the “study of which nouns represent real entities and which nouns only represent a concept ”.
Metaphysical naturalism denies the existence of God.
Its theoretical basis believes all phenomena can be explained by the concept of natural reason, which was put forward by philosophers who support science and evolution theory.
Methodological naturalism refers to the research method of keeping silence about God.
Spiritual philosophy is a branch of philosophy that studies the essence of consciousness and its relationship with the body (especially the brain).
Dualism and monism are the two main schools of thought to discuss the relationship between “mind and body ”.
Epistemology is a branch of philosophy that discusses the essence, origin and scope of knowledge.
Ethics is a discipline which carries out systematic thinking and research on human moral life; here, morality is defined as all the codes of conduct recognized by a group of people or a culture.
It is mainly divided into meta-ethics (study of the essence of ethical theory or criticism in an abstract way), normative ethics (judge different moral concepts, and to give moral code suggestions for correct or wrong behavior).
It studies what kind of moral code of conduct people should abide by), applied ethics (the research where ethical theory is applied to actual living conditions, including bioethics, political ethics), descriptive ethics (collect information about how people live, and summarize from the observed patterns.
Its examination on ethics does not originate from the expected theory, but it investigates the real choices made and observed by the actual moral agent, all the moral factors leading to this decision; it studies the ethics held by social groups).
The history of ethics includes Greek and Roman ethics and medieval Christian ethics.
Part I: the ethical thought of humanism, represented by Valla and Montaigne.
Part II: the ethical thought of religious reform, represented by Calvin.
Part III: political ethics, represented by Machiavelli and others; modern ethics (17th - 18th century, British empirical ethics, representatives: Hume et al., 17th - 18th century, European rationalist ethics, representatives: Spinoza et al., 18th century, French enlightenment ethics, representatives: Voltaire et al., 18th - 19th century, German academic ethics, representatives: Kant, Hegel et al., 18th - 19th century, British utilitarian ethics, representatives: Bentham, Sikivik et al., 19th century, Britain National evolutionary ethics, representatives: Spencer, Huxley, et al., late 19th century, German Neo Kantian ethics, representatives: Li Kaier et al., late 19th century, Neo Hegelian ethics, representatives: Thomas Hill Green et al.), transitional Ethics (irrational ethics, representatives: Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche et al.).
Logic is a discipline which studies “the principles and standards of valid argument and proof ”.
Logic usually includes three parts: inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning and deductive reasoning, which can be divided into formal logic and informal logic.
Aesthetics is a discipline which studies the essence and significance of beauty.

Yang Xingche, real name Jiang Bo, was born in the month of the sheep in the year of the sheep; the name Yang Xingche means the sheep feel most comfortable when they are on grass; people call him Uncle Yang (Sheep in Chinese).
He is called “thriller genius ” in the industry due to the publication of his“ Foreign Password ” series including Strange Stories in Thailand, Strange Stories in India, Strange Stories in Japan and Strange Stories in Korea, and he said that he ’s “good at talking serious nonsense ”

One thing was missing, and even the McNuggets was charged.
Ask the restaurant to send it up here.
I don’t want to go downstairs to shop, which is why I spend so much in delivery.
Ding Zilin: to friends.
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all my friends for their humanitarian assistance for more than 30 years after the death of our family, especially the uninterrupted assistance since I made an appeal for humanitarian assistance to friends at home and abroad in my own name at the beginning of 1994.
Now the old parents of the vast majority of the victims have passed away, and the orphans have also grown up, started working and got married.
It is your chivalrous deeds that have helped these families in distress pass the most difficult time.
At present, COVID - 19 is raging around the world, and most donors have retired.
Therefore, I sincerely ask you to stop making humanitarian donations to the family of victims, Tiananmen Mothers group; this humanitarian relief event should have come to a perfect end long ago.
I will remember your kindness forever and firmly believe your chivalrous deeds will be remembered by history forever.
For various reasons, I can only express my wishes in this way; please understand!
Please accept my sincere wishes.
Tao Yean: please allow me to take this opportunity to make a brief introduction to the 32 - year history of humanitarian assistance of IFCSS and MCDF.
In the process of humanitarian relief, IFCSS and MCDF are parallel organizations, and there are often intersections between the project executors.
(Apple Daily photo: Tiananmen Mother website is managed by Tao Ye.) pic.twitter.com/UxID9ZGjzm
The relief funds often fail to reach the family of the victims of the June 4th Movement successfully.
In 1994, Ding advised that the “Tiananmen Mother ” set up a special group to coordinate and take charge of the receipt and distribution of humanitarian relief funds.
In 1998, MCDF established the “June 4th Orphan Education Fund ”; after 11 years of implementation, in 2009, after all the June 4th orphans graduated from University, MCDF then established the“ June 4th Elderly with No Family Destitute Poverty Relief Fund ”, which has been implemented until now.
The funds for these projects mainly came from campus and social donations of generous individual donations in the year of June 4th event, and were supported by the democracy foundation of brother universities.
Since 2018, it has also been supported by the Reform through Labor Research Foundation.
Last year, after 31 years, the family of the victims of the June 4th Movement finally received a part of the donation made by Hong Kong in the name of the June 4th Movement.
During this period, China Human Rights is also independently implementing their humanitarian relief project.
We understand that Ding called a stop to the June 4th donation for the consideration of the donors; we are indeed retired elderly, and our income is not as much as before; we hereby thank teacher Ding for his “Letter to Friends ”.
We will respect the decision of the family of the victims and terminate this project within two years and resume it immediately when necessary.
I would like to express my gratitude and respect to those chivalrous fellows who have been giving generously and taking risks to deliver humanitarian relief funds for many years.

Member reviews
[Effect] Photo effects: I shot two outfits, and it was overall nice; I prefer the outfit on this picture ~
[Service] Service details: I was uncomfortable doing makeup because I was pregnant, and the makeup artist and staff were considerate enough to have me rest for while and keep pouring warm water for me.
Set price: 1,000 yuan
Thanks to Tuzi for commenting; I thought I would say no to the ancient style because it didn't suit me, unexpectedly the results were stunning.
Thanks to Dandan for your recognition, your satisfaction will keep us going forward, and we will keep making improvement!
This photography studio is truly great, highly recommend it for everyone!
It was impeccable, no matter it ’s reception, makeup, outfits, lighting or photography.
The makeup artist was attentive to details and would choose the makeup most suitable for you based on your style; the makeup products were also from leading brands.
Not to mention Tian Liang, who is really a professional photographer.
The whole studio is artistic, and there are two kittens to play with you.
We work in Beijing, and better studios in Beijing require queuing up half a year in advance; I have a colleague who did the photoshoot in Beijing and felt the photos were just so so.
I specifically found this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management was poor, and I think this is a problem for most people, but photographer Liang is good at capturing the natural and wonderful moments.
A brilliant team with makeup artist, photographer and post-editing design.
After the photos came out, we and everyone around us were full of praises for them.
I have recommended my girlfriend to come, who was also satisfied with the photos.
I hope studio like this will get the attention it deserves and more people can discover it and shoot photos with their own style instead of being the same as everyone else.
Thank you to Zhanying and Jinglung for your five-star reviews, you are both creative new comers; we are a creative studio, and as long as customers like it, we will give our 200% to do it; we are grateful for meeting you.
Everyone on the team was nice, the sweet assistant, the lively photographer; it was a wonderful and unforgettable experience, and the photos were so much better than what I imagined them to be; thank you so much to everyone for your great efforts 😘😘
Thank you to Xiaoyu for your review, it was destiny to have met you; from Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, your trust in us is as long as the several thousand kilometers road; I am happy to get acquainted with you and hope you can come back to Qinhuangdao.
How should I pay?
The de-delivered food has arrived.
No delivery person received it.
Now the restaurant employee is calling me.
I am a programming newbie and I want to share my experience.
If you want to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to get some training, but if you don’t want to, it ’s better to study on your own; after all, trainings are expensive and it will take you six months to learn it.
However, if you want to enter this industry, then training is a great option, especially for those who are extremely not self-disciplined.
You can choose to teach yourself if you are self-disciplined, but it will be tiring.
Certainly, selecting a good training agency is very important.
You need to first look at the faculty of this agency; if it ’s not strong enough, you can cross that agency off your list; of course, some new agencies don’t have strong faculties.
Secondly, you shall do some research on the agency before choosing it; it ’s best to contact former students of the agency; after all, only students know how the agency really is and whether the curriculum is good or not.
Hello, actually I ’m not sure how to answer your question since you didn’t introduce your own situation, and learning this is closely related to your situation.
Such as your major, age, the language you want to learn, and even which city you are in; all of these are related to what you want to learn or what industry you want to go into.
If you are a student who haven’t graduated yet, or if you are a computer major and have graduated, then I recommend learning it yourself if you have time, and this is the method with lowest efficiency and cost; many offline and online training agencies are good now, but it comes with great cost and takes a lot of time; it basically needs a concentrated training of three to six months.
However, if you are in the same situation as I mentioned, it is convenient to learn it yourself; many learning resources are free online, or you can gain access to a lot of training resources on Bilibili; if you don’t know how to search for them, you can contact me according to my bio and get free resources or detailed consultation.
There are also classic books to supplement your study with videos.
If you are not a computer major, but you can pay certain amount of money and devote your time to your learning, then I suggest you go to an agency to study; it ’ll be easier this way as the teachers will explain in detail and there will be designated people answering your questions; in addition, it ’ll be helpful to your study planning or help you get supervision.
Further, many training agencies will sign employment agreement; they have quota for internal promotion, and you can be recommended to a company after your learning, so that the job interview process can be easier.
The above is my opinion; as I said, I don’t know about your situation so my introduction is not detailed; if you want to consult other things, you may contact me any time.
I said it should arrive before 1 o’clock, and I ’ve seen it in the App.
What is the...
I haven’t finished speaking, what are you doing?
I undertake all kinds of housekeeping services including installation, cleaning, and maintenance of wall mounted water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove, range hood, lamp installation, glass cleaning, and professional sewing.
Thanks to everyone who liked my post; I will carry on working hard although life is difficult.
Life will not let hardworking people down; follow me if you like me; thank you to everyone who have liked my post.
This is life; others only see the result and you must go through it alone; in the face of life, we can only stay strong and carry on; there is no other choice; you can look back on life, but you cannot relive it...
Cleaning is a job and a responsibility; life is more beautiful with services, and services are wonderful because we work hard.
Although we do the most dirty work in cleaning, we will try to clean all the corners of the client ’s house with our hard work; the moment I see the client ’s smile and big thumb up, all the efforts spent are worthwhile; your hard work will pay off!
My daily work
- your requirements, my service.
Keep the beauty with attentive service and cleaning.
Feng Gui Housekeeping will try our best to care for the details you care about and love your house with our services.
Keep thousands of houses clean, establish a brand of housekeeping; standard service, in-house cleaning.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work
Although the crystal lamp looks luxurious, it will be dim if it has not cleaned for a long time; only after cleaning, can it shine brightly, and so is life.
Do it with heart and we can succeed; we are serious about creating exquisite things with our attention to details, and we are serious about cleaning seams.
Give me a chance and you will be satisfied; quality is everything, because professionalism is worth trusting; your recognition is the best encouragement to me!
At present, there is not one industry that is easy to do!
But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persistent and hard-working, I will be slightly better than others; it ’s at least better than sitting around and complaining! ”
Morning is the most important time of the day; all the good things begin in the morning; I hope you can start a new day with happiness, luck, health and joy; keep a good mood all day long; good morning.
When we were children, happiness was a thing, and we were happy when we had it; when we grow up, happiness is a goal, and we will be happy when we reach it; after maturity, I found that happiness is actually a state of mind, and understanding is happiness.
Be the truest and kindest self, act according to your heart, and leave no regrets in your life; life is a road, go your own way; there are two treasures in life: good health and good mood, and you will live a beautiful life!
We will encounter different difficulties in different stages of life.
Often times, what is restraining you is not you ability but your courage to face it actively.
Since you cannot hide, you ’d rather face it.
The more scared you are, the easier you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you take it head on, the problem will be solved.
Exhibition planners of China and Saudi Arabia work together to hold the first contemporary art biennale of Saudi Arabia - Xinhuanet
Message from Xinhua News Agency Riyadh on December 12 (journalists: Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan): The first contemporary art biennale of Saudi Arabia, Diriyah contemporary art biennale, was officially opened to the public in the JAX arts district of Diriyah in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, on December 11, and a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other countries and regions participated in the exhibition.
The biennale is planned jointly by Diriyah biennale foundation of Saudi Arabia and UCCA of China, and Tian Feiyu, curator of UCCA of China, works as the art director.
According to the introduction from the planning team, the theme of the biennale is “crossing the river by feeling the stones ”, which is a metaphor of the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transition period and reflects the current situations of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
The biennale occupies an area of nearly twelve thousand square meters, and the exhibition hall stretches across six connected buildings with six units: Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones, Inheritance as an Experiment, Thinking at the Edge, Walking to the Public, Beautiful New Word and On the Spirit of Arts.
In which the number of the works of the 27 artists from Saudi Arabia accounts for more than 40% of the total number of the exhibits, including various art forms such as drawing, installation art and performing art; the works of the 12 Chinese artists also attracted much attention, and some artists create with recycled materials in an innovative way; for example, Xu Bing reconstructed a classic landscape painting with wastes in Behind the Story Series, Picture of Endless Streams and Mountains (2014).
According to Buckley, CEO of Diriyah biennale foundation, it is hoped that the biennale can establish an international dialogue, provide global audiences with opportunities to understand the vigorously developed culture industry and innovative communities in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen interactions.
Tian Feiyu said, “The biennale has two objectives, i.e., establishing dialogue between contemporary art of Saudi Arabia and the world, and integrating audiences of Saudi Arabia into the contemporary art world. ”
It is understood that there will be a series of lectures during the biennale, and artists, exhibition planners and leaders of innovative industries will engage in discussions on cross-cultural communication, contemporary art development and other topics.
I ordered axe-handle steak.
The restaurant told me the delivery person could not deliver bones.
I want to ask why.
The bones are okay, ask the restaurant to wrap them up separately and deliver them.
But the system was not easy to use, and I normally used the other room.
I ’m at # ADDRESS #, the branch store at Meixinli.
I ’m far from that place.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize management of rural public welfare posts - Xinhuanet
Message from Xinhua News Agency Kunming on December 12 (journalist: Lin Bifeng): In order to continue to provide assistance to the employment of people lifted out of poverty, consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation work, Yunnan Province has released policies on the management of public welfare position in villages for promoting rural revitalization, as a way to comprehensively promote rural revitalization.

The address is wrong.
Hello,
Can I cancel the order?
I will re-place the order.
Is it canceled yet?
2. Although the Rightists had their time in history, it was not long, and the reason why it was short was they were over their head once they got a tiny bit of sweetness; a little success will lead to insatiable desires, and just one blow and they will lose their ground to exist.
But to speak the truth, the Rightists have once played a positive role in the process of social progress.
The positive significance of the Rightists should not be denied in terms of ending the cultural revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights.
3. For me, although I don’t fully agree with some of Li Weidong ’s statements, I really care about his statements and respect Li Weidong; Because he is conscientious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China ’s social problems seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory; I believe that unnecessary revolution should be opposed to; revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest and damage to people ’s livelihood; political groups will be mixed, and foreign countries will avail themselves of the opportunity to get in.
4. Changing or improving China requires patience and the attitude to be responsible for the country and the people; those who try to make money from political opportunities are not Rightists, but bastards.
Let ’s talk about Leftists.
Leftists, in fact, are a group of outcasts of the times and politics.
If the Rightists are of positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the Rightists ’ remarks and analyze their thoughts when necessary, the Leftists don’t have such luck, because what the Leftists want is the dross thrown away by the Communist Party!
5. Recently, I saw some friends refuting the rebels and crazy Leftists at the same time, and they got really angry; I don't think it ’s necessary at all.
Don’t try to reason with rebels and crazy Leftists; they are all one track minded and unreasonable.
Don’t try to prove we are right, and don’t even think about asking rebels and crazy Leftists to admit it; why bother?
I told my friends: when the rebels call you a fifty-cent and when the leftist call you a rightist dog, they prove we are on the correct track in the middle!
Many people had dreams when they were young, but they forgot about them when they got older; or, they pursue their dreams and become paranoid.
They drift apart from their dreams and the young Dragon Slayer will eventually become a vicious dragon.
I think left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom; the innate genes of China ’s history and culture make China overall relatively left.
The domestic Rightists are free and stress efficiency and development, while the Leftists strengthen supervision and pay more attention to fairness and safety.
At present, society overall hopes to pay more attention to justice; at the same time, it is certain that when China and the United States fight, it is bound to lean towards left, which is estimated to continue for many years.
Just like it if you don’t understand.
No need to say more, Huahua is generous.
In the past two years, the blockade and interception of the US on Huawei chips not only made Huawei fall into an unprecedented difficult position but also made “American ” enterprises suffer from huge losses.
The US suppresses China ’s chips industry and required its own enterprises and relevant enterprises of its allies to block China ’s chip industry at the same time; the direct consequence was that the number of orders and profits of global chip suppliers were affected, resulting in the decrease in the investment of research and development and production capacity of chip manufacturers, which further led to the disorder of chip supply chain shortages on a global scale.
Today, “lack of chips ” has affected all major industries of the world, resulting in the suspension of production of car enterprises and rise in prices of mobile phones; almost all the industries using chips are greatly impacted.
To gain the right to make their own decisions on “chips ”, more and more countries ’ tech giants are taking the path of“ de-Americanized ”.
In order to firmly holding the right to control global semiconductor in its hands and pin down the development of China ’s semiconductor industry, the United States have made frequent moves recently such as hosting the “chip summit ”, inviting the giants of 64 countries to establish a semiconductor alliance and allocating funds to support the local technology giants in the United States; in order to regain its leading position in the chip industry, Intel, an old technology giant in the United States, spent $20 billion to build two wafer processing plants in Arizona, US and opened its chip OEM business.
When most people think Intel ’s move will make certain impact on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and even steal their job.
They are sure about it because Intel, as an old tech giant in the US, worked diligently in the semiconductor industry for dozens of years and have a large amount of talent teams and technological reserve; it is bound to rise within a short time and defeat Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.
However, Zhang Zhongmou, founder of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, sniffed at the decision of Intel.
At the “2021 Master Think Tank Forum ” held in April this year, Zhang Zhongmou made a surprising remark and spoke bluntly about Intel ’s move to build a wafer factory,“ it is rather ironic for Intel to build an OEM factory of chips ”.
Zhang Zhongmou disdained Intel ’s decision to get into the wafer industry because Zhang Zhong still holds a grudge against a feud between Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Intel more than 30 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s, Intel has been the pearl in the manufacturing industry of the United States, occupying the leading position in the world; it was a king in the semiconductor industry in the world.
Until the 1980s, the world's high-end semiconductor chips have been controlled by a few strong ones.
At that time, the semiconductor industry was characterized by IDM mode; chips were designed, manufactured and sealed by the same factory, and Intel was a representative of that era.
However, such a model has overwhelmed some small enterprises, and many semiconductor entrepreneurs could only flinch in the face of huge production line construction costs.
To respond to the calling of market demand, after entering the 1980s, the phenomenon of division of labor and cooperation of chips industry began to appear; in 1984, Zhang Zhongmou heard that there were companies specializing in chip design, so he thought that since there were companies specializing in design, a factory specializing in wafer manufacturing could be established.
Soon after, Zhang Zhongmou ’s imagination became reality, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was created.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company aimed to set the single link of “processing of wafers ” as its primary business; without design, only OEM services of wafer manufacturing was provided.
The newly established Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was only a small player in front of Intel the giant.
In order to gain capital support, Zhang Zhongmou once approached Intel for investment, but Intel was arrogant when it heard Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company only participated in the manufacturing of the chips industry; Intel looked down on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and resolutely refused to invest in it.
Zhang Zhongmou also believed that Intel despised wafer manufacturing services at that time.
Unexpectedly, the giant that looked down on wafer manufacturing services back in the days will also start to do wafer foundry now.
Therefore, Zhang Zhongmou thinks it is ironic for Intel to work on wafer foundry.
The market value of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company has surpassed that of Intel.
Facing the powerful attack of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Intel naturally dares not to stand still.
Now, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is trying to develop to the 3nm chips, and Intel still stays at the 14nm 7 years ago.
It is actually not difficulty to surpass it.
I won’t wait any more.
It will be 2 hours since I placed the order at 19: 06 😅
Let ’s see some “strange trending topics ” today.
What is normal public opinion?
Select three trending topics randomly, the rise of the head of the dragon on the 2nd of February, the price rise of ORLON, and the Huolala incident; the public opinion spread to form a peak, and then the [index declined] to form a (smooth curve) until it finally dissipated; if a secondary public opinion occurs, there will be a small hump again.
They look no different from the [evolution model of online public opinion] once displayed on the official website of Cyberspace Administration.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select three trending topics from the same event, there are [solitary peak], [zigzag] and [cliff].
[Solidary peak] means the topic is artificially heated, quickly rushing to the trending topics list and attracting public attention; [Zigzag] refers to periodic heating, ensuring that topic stays on the trending topics list; [Cliff] means collective evacuation; after the topic has played its “function ”, they received a new task and rushed to a new battlefield.
In picture 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is exactly the same; it must be because a unified batch of paid internet trolls have received the task and started a new round of offensive.
The professionalism of black public relations can be seen: dozens of trending topics are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for explanation, which lead to argument and accumulate momentum, which divert attention, which affect understanding, which mislead judgment, which incite emotion, which coerce decision-making; the black production accounts work in batches and conduct segmented operations in different batches and time nodes, taking into account almost all elements in the spread of public opinion.
Communication is a science which disregards all subjective factors such as standpoint and emotion and only takes into account objective data; black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
Traces will be left from anyone walked by, and we can dig out these traces together.
Source of data: trending topics time machine.
Omicron strain infection cases were found in Mauritius and other countries for the first time - Xinhuanet
Message from Xinhua News Agency Beijing on December 12, reported by foreign corespondent of comprehensive Xinhua News Agency: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported to have found the infection cases of Omicron strains, the new COVID - 19 variant, for the first time.
Mauritius reported two infection cases of Omicron strains on December 10 for the first time.
According to introduction from Kelesh Jagutpal, Minister of Ministry of Health of Mauritius, one of the infected people was a tourist departing from South Africa and arriving in Mauritius on November 27; the other infected person was a local resident of Mauritius, who was tested positive in nucleic acid test on November 30 after contacting a person who returned from South Africa.
The nucleic acid test results of the two infected people changed to negative after quarantine and receiving treatment in the hospital, and now they have returned to their own respective residence.
It was announced by Ministry of Health of Cyprus on December 10 that the country confirmed three cases of infection with the Omicron strains for the first time.
All of the 3 infected people were students who came back after traveling in other countries at the beginning of this month; all of them were not hospitalized because they were mild cases.
In order to prevent the spreading of the Omicron strains, the government of Cyprus kept strengthening the prevention and control.
All the passengers above 12 years old who enter the country by plane shall take nucleic acid test at their own expenses at the airport from December 6 to January 10 next year.
It was also announced by Ministry of Health of Cyprus on December 10 that they would start inoculate children from 5 to 11 years old in the country with Pfizer COVID - 19 vaccine.
Kunbizze Chiponda, Minister of Ministry of Health of Malawi, said on December 9 that Malawi found 3 cases of infection with the Omicron strains for the first time.
The Department of Health of Malawi conducted genomic sequencing for 12 COVID - 19 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2 and found the 3 cases of infection.

What I received is tripe.

Okay, the phone number is # PHONENUMBER #.
Do I need to stay in this conversation?
I # NAME # called your staff to explain it.
Your delivery person told me the address is too far.
Damei 360 Integrated Home Decoration
Address: Happy Home Building 12, South Ring Road 156
I trusted it because my friend made the recommendation, so I chose to check it out, and originally my budget for a basic decoration was 70,000.
A series of scam began as soon as I came into the store.
When I first came to the store, I showed them my floor plan; although they didn’t really go to my apartment to take the measurement, they said they could do it within 70,000 for my 135 square meters apartment, and they showed me their materials whose brand was unclear.
The second scam was forcing you to pay the deposit, which cannot be refunded once paid, unless you have enough experience to reason with them.
As I hesitated about whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that once I paid the deposit on that day, they could give me certain discount.
This is a big swindle, and I was a victim who paid a deposit of more than 10,000 when I didn’t really think it through.
Their quoted price had a lot of problems; for instance, the 70,000 didn’t include water and electricity renovation, doors, cabinets or bathrooms, and these three take up a large proportion of the cost of basic installation.
Apart from these, their service point fee is also higher than that of other companies.
I ’ve lost trust in this company, because they asked me to sign the contract when they didn’t explain anything clearly.
When I went to ask for a refund, they acted rather experienced and sent a small team to deal with me.
Anyway, they just said it was the client ’s problem and they had absolutely no responsibility for it.
They just shrunk their responsibility in any way possible, and there were a lot more details that I don’t want to mention now; all in all, do not choose them because my friend had them renovate her apartment, and the quality was poor and they would charge you all kinds of other costs in the later stage.
Swindle; they used to be the swindler company Longtou Renovation, then it ’s changed to Damei, and now it seems they have closed down and changed into something else.
So please don’t choose such a swindler company.
When you choose renovation companies in the future, please search them on Baidu because renovation cost is not a small amount.
If you want to ask the merchant a question, please log in or register first.
It is strictly prohibited to publish any type of merchant review, and please refer to the Merchant Inclusion Statement for details.
Dianping Kunming Renovation and Design Channel will provide you with the address, phone number, operation time and other information of Damei 360 Integrated Home Renovation, and please come to Dianping if you are looking for a renovation company.
It ’s so horrible, and I will cancel the order if it doesn’t arrive in 30 minutes!
Is there really no other way? For example, change the address?
OK, then don’t cancel this conversation, and I ’ll pursue it further if I don’t receive the refund in 5 to 10 days.
I asked if I could cancel it if it didn’t arrive in 15 minutes.
Poached Chicken with Chili Sauce is supposed to be fully cooked, but what I received is raw and inedible.
Rendezvous with the starry sky | Geminid meteor shower will usher in the maximum scale on December 14 - Xinhuanet
Message from Xinhua News Agency Tianjin on December 12 (journalist: Zhou Runjian) According to introduction from astronomy science popularization expert, as the final large-scale meteor shower this year, the geminid meteor shower as one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere will be the maximum on December 14, and people who like meteor showers can observe during the latter half of the night on that day.
Photo of geminid meteor shower shot on December 13, 2018 in Qinghai by An Jiu, a lover of astronomy from Beijing.
The parent object of most of the meteor showers are periodic comets; however, the parent object of the geminid meteor showers is Phaethon, No. 3200 asteroid, which is also an Apollo type asteroid.
The geminid meteor shower is the second known meteor shower that is not “bred ” by comets so far.
According to introduction from Xiu Lipeng, a member of the Council of Tianjin Astronomy Society and an expert of astronomical science popularization, just like a new year blockbuster, geminid meteor shower generally occurs at the end of a year, with the “screening time ” lasting from December 4 to December 17.
The geminid meteor shower is known for its ample flow and stabilization, which is called together with the Quadrantal meteor shower and the Perseids meteor shower as the three major meteor showers of the Northern Hemisphere.
A significant characteristic of the geminid meteor shower is the slow speed of the meteoroid, the abundant colors and the large number of fireballs, which is suitable for both visual observation and shooting by beginners of astronomical photography.
This is the photo of geminid meteor shower shot on December 13, 2020 in Qinghai by Yang Jing, a lover of astronomy from Tianjin.
Based on astronomical forecast, the geminid meteor shower this year will be reach its maximum scale at about 15: 00 on December 14, and the ZHR at the maximum (in the ideal observation conditions, when the radiation point is right above the head, and the number of the meteors that can be seen every hour) is 150.
Chart of index of recommendation level of the geminid meteor shower.
“Last year, people were impressed by the geminid meteor shower; however, the geminid meteor shower this year will be influenced by moon light, and its brilliance will be slightly influenced.
December 14 is November 11 in Chinese calendar, with the moon in the gibbous phase; the bright moonlight will interfere with the observation; fortunately, the moon will go down in the latter half of the night, and the radiation point of the geminid meteor shower will rise higher.
People who like meteor showers can observe it in the hours after moon goes down in the latter half of the night, but remember to stay warm. ”
How to observe as many meteors as possible?
“It is not advised to observe meteor showers in the city; you may choose a place facing northeast and has high altitude, a wide view and little light pollution, and then you may observe with your eyes after the moon goes down.
It should be noted that the geminid meteor shower will have heavy flows on all directions, and you do not need to keep staring the radiation point of the geminid meteor shower.
People who like photography can select wide angle lens and large aperture, and use high ISO and the maximum aperture while shooting if you want to take marvelous shots of the meteor shower.
Based on consideration of stability and sustainability, a tripod, a standby battery and a shutter release are also necessary. ”
Xiu Lipeng reminded.
What is the difference between laser TV and traditional TV in terms of the market positioning?
In my understanding, traditional TV which the original post mentioned is LCD TV, and the differences between laser TV and LCD TV in terms of market positioning are mainly the following two points:
First, laser TV focuses more on big screen market.
Compared with the all-round market positioning of LCD TV, laser TV is obviously more focused on the large screen market, or laser TV itself is a product of big screen.
At present, the size of mainstream LCD TV is mainly from 55 to 65 inches, and the size of laser TV is usually over 75 inches, with bigger ones over 100 inches, which can satisfy the customers ’ need for big screen TVs.
In recent years, the proportion of the global shipments and sales of laser TV keeps increasing, accounting for over 60% of the total TV sales of 80 inches and above.
According to the prediction of CMM, the sales volume of laser TV market in 2020 will increase by over 140% and will continue to maintain a high-speed growth.
The reason for such great result in the big screen market is mainly the outstanding performance of laser TVs in eye protection.
Based on the imaging principle of diffuse reflection of laser TV, the light emitted by the laser light source does not go directly into the eyeball; compared with the backlight of LCD TV, its imaging process is closer to that of objects under natural conditions, with less irritation to the eyes.
Ophthalmologists from CES Laboratory, China Electronics Standardization Institute, and Peking Union Medical College Hospital obtained 144 groups of test data through a strict comparative experiment of watching laser TV and LCD TV under the same conditions.
Statistics prove that laser TVs can indeed protect the eyes and may even make improvement in certain aspects.
As eye protection is gaining more and more attention, laser TVs not only attracted more and more customers with the feature of eye protection, but also made another breakthrough in the market of color TVs.
Second, laser TV focuses more on high-end market.
Contrary to the downward trend of the price of LCD TVs, price of laser TVs on the market now is over 10,000 yuan, and it went up gradually with the upgrading of size and source of light.
Why are laser TVs so expensive?
There must be a reason.
With the continuous development of light source and technology, laser TVs have advantages that many LCD TVs and projectors don’t.
With the super short focus projection technology, the projection distance of laser TVs is shorter than that of traditional projection equipment; it can realize the 100 inch large screen experience within a short distance; the space required is not large, and the small host takes up very little space.
In terms of lightness, laser TVs from famous brands can reach over 2,000 lumens.
Plus, the heat is lower, equipment loss is small, and the service life of TV is longer.
In addition, many high-end laser TVs are equipped with real 4K ultra HD image, artificial intelligent systems, bionic screens and other cutting-edge technologies, bringing users a more stunning audio-visual experience.
It's not so much of a fake demand, but the product of demand segmentation; when it comes to image quality and input-output ratio, laser TVs are not what video and audio enthusiasts are after; if you want to take into account the lack of large screen and viewing environment, you can try it; everything has its pros and cons, and you can make a decision yourself after deliberation; just don’t listen to only one side of the story.
Simply put, in order to get close to the screen, ultra wide angle close focus projector, laser TV, has to use expensive ultra wide angle lens and reflector, which is not in line with the best optical design.
In order to shield part of the ambient light, it uses an expensive microstructure Fresnel screen; the price of an 80 - inch laser TV basically can be changed into a 65 - inch LCD TV.
Another point is that I especially hate it when projector manufacturers using “diffuse reflection is good for the eyes ” as a selling point; please, eyes can see the light on the screen means that it is direct light to the eyes; when it hit the ceiling, eyes cannot see it; if you want to be serious about it, then LCD TV also uses diffused“ direct light ”; isn’t the ceiling also illuminated when you turn on the TV?
Moreover, if the projection screen does not use diffuse reflection, imaging is not possible at all.
The hot spot (light spot) effect of the high gain screen is ignored, and a large amount of light at a certain angle being reflected into the eyes is really uncomfortable.
Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Studio Premium Store has no branch store yet
I added their WeChat to make an appointment, then they sent me the available dates; their reply was speedy ~
I went to the store to see the photography works, and there were more beautiful outdoor wedding dress photos and a lot of different styles.
After I arrived that day, I communicated my own ideas with the young lady and she patiently helped me try on two outfits I was having trouble deciding and I made the final decision before starting styling and makeup ~ the photographer would place some props and guide me to pose before the shoot, and was very attentive to the details.
However, the photos taken were not in the style I wanted, perhaps it was because they didn’t communicate with me about the specific shooting ideas, but the photos should look nice 🙊🙊
After the shoot, the photographer would help pick the photos, communicate about post-editing style, and I think it was very thoughtful.
It will take about half a month to edit all the photos and I look forward to seeing them ~
This is the second time that I have won the chance to experience a photoshoot for free ~ you may choose one from most of the available outfits to do the photoshoot.
Eventually, I chose a black veil skirt so as to experience a different style.
The entire photoshoot took about 2 hours including the makeup and shoot; the photographer was a young guy born after 1995, who seemed to be a little shy; I hope he could give more advice to clients in terms of poses ~ he was talkative and the shoot was pleasant.
Wenshe Visual Aesthetics Photography Studio Premium Store reply
It is on the front page, come and see Queenie ~
After I arrived at the store, I filled in my name and chose the outfits; all the wedding dresses were available to be chosen; I tried on three or four outfits and they were quite patient; after I decided on the dress, they were doing my makeup for a long time and they were also nice during this time; later in the shoot, they would teach you how to pose; I felt my face was too big on the photo; they said detailed editing would take a month, but they sent them to me after three to four days, and they seemed not that different from the original photos.
[Environment] It was not bad overall.
There are a lot of outfits to choose from.
There are about three seats for doing makeup and the studio is inside.
[Service] Very enthusiastic and attentive to details.
The stylist was patient.
Photographer would patiently teach you to pose.
If you are not satisfied, the photographer would propose to take it again.
[Experience] Maybe the style was a little too much, double eyelids turned into triple eyelids.
The tail of my eyebrow got shaved, and it was a little awkward for those who don’t wear makeup normally.
The photos were sent to me after about ten days, but I was not very satisfied with the photoshop effect, and I feel that the double eyelids tapes are still obvious.
I tried on two outfits because I didn’t know what style to choose, and I ended up choosing the black suit after trying hesitating; the young lady said it was a vintage Audrey Hepburn style.
After choosing the outfit, we began with the hair and makeup; the hair stylist and makeup artist were super patient and I was really satisfied.
The photoshoot started after finishing makeup and hair, and the photographer guided me to pose the whole time; the process was relaxed and harmonious.
After the photoshoot, I chose my four favorite ones to be retouched, and the guy said the photos would be completed within 15 days and I was really satisfied with the results ~
There has been no replies for three days, and as your system cannot identify my credit card, I can’t join the # PRS _ ORG # plus monthly fee project!
What is strange is that I paid with the same credit card every time.
I have to pay the delivery fee every time now.
It can be exempted, and you can charge me with the monthly fee after the investigation, is that Okay?
Is it safe to buy insurance on Little Umbrella?
Little Umbrella is an insurance brokerage platform on the internet.
In terms of setup conditions: according to the "Regulations on the Supervision of Insurance Brokerage Institutions (revised in 2015)", the following three key requirements must be met to become an insurance brokerage company, shareholders and initiator have no major illegal records in the past three years, the minimum limit is 50 million yuan, and it must be approved by the CIRC.
These three requirements are strict enough; in summary, it needs to have strength, to be approved by the national authoritative departments of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (supervising insurance companies and banks across the country), and the shareholders ’ conduct is descent; as an insurance brokerage company, Little Umbrella Insurance doesn’t need to be questioned by policyholders about whether it is legal or not; after all, not all insurance companies can meet these three requirements.
In this regard, it is not bad and worth trusting.
In terms of insurance products: Little Umbrella Insurance is an insurance supermarket, with star serious illness insurances of many companies on sale on this platform; for example, for the newly added HTLIC Super Mario 5 serious illness insurance, both the claim adjuster and the insurer are HTLIC, and Little Umbrella Insurance is only the third-party intermediary, whose reliability does not need to be questioned.
In terms of payment method: due to the lack of the operating expenses of the business outlets and the cost of the sales people ’s salaries, internet products are generally cost-effective, and the payment method is flexible, which supports monthly payment; it reduces the payment pressure of the policyholder, and can leverage of the insurance lever to the greatest extent in the meantime.
This is good.
It can be considered.
In terms of the professional level of sales personnel: this is especially important as insurance industry has a strict requirement on expertise; for many internet products, customers can apply for insurance by themselves, which will cause many misunderstandings; in terms of health notification and occupation, non-insurance practitioners often add their subjective awareness when applying for insurance, and feel that they are healthy or in line with it; like this, there will be a lot of hidden dangers in claims settlement and the risk of being rejected.
I worked as insurance telemarketing personnel in “Tencent Micro-Insurance ” (like Little Umbrella, it is also an Internet insurance brokerage platform), and I can tell you.
The insurance products on the internet are real and reliable, and it is the people who are not reliable; there are no professional practitioners on the internet, and there is much misleading information in sales.
For example: there is nothing wrong with sales strategies like 1 yuan insurance covers 6 million yuan, buy insurance and get free mobile phones, and get 60,000 serious illness insurance coverage for free; however, they withhold important information and won't tell the policyholder that the first month is 1 yuan, and the fee next month is charged normally, ranging from a few dozens to 200; many customers don’t know what they bought after they ’ve been charged for one or two years.
They thought they could spend 1 yuan and get a six million claim settlement from the insurance company (pie in the sky).
Getting mobile phone for free means only policy ending with special numbers such as 6666 and 8888 can get a free phone, and no one will remind you again if the text message is sent to you and you don’t redeem it yourself.
(This is yet another trap for the policyholder) It is a short-term activity to claim 60000 serious disease insurance for free; if you only rely on this and there is no other commercial insurance, 60000 yuan will not solve any problem in case of the happening of a serious disease, and you will have nothing in your life later.
Our country is also cracking down on misleading Internet insurance sales at present.
Therefore, there is no problem with the platform or the products; what matters is the professionalism and professional integrity of the salesperson.
It is suggested that the original post should think about it carefully; in fact, there are many offline insurance brokerage companies with a wider range of products, and customers have more opportunities and products to choose from; some products are better than Internet products in terms of cost performance.
I myself have helped 59 Internet customers to underwrite offline products, helping each person save 2000 - 3000 yuan of premium per year.
If you have any question, feel free to communicate with me.
I am a Mingya Insurance Broker and have three years of experience in enterprise management training; I have served almost a thousand enterprise users and cooperated with over 100 insurance companies; before insuring, I will analyze the needs of my client and customize products for them; while insuring, I will compare all the insurance companies and help my client achieve the best underwriting result; after insuring, I will organize and hold the insurance policy to make my client feel at ease.
Grow with each client for a lifetime.
Hopefully my answer will help the original post!
According to the definition of insurance supervising departments, Internet insurance is an insurance business in which the applicant can complete the entire insurance process independently after clicking the insuring link.
In this process, neither the applicant nor the insurance consultant needs to sign, so all the steps can be fulfilled independently by the applicant.
Although insuring an Internet insurance product has no “sense of ritual ”, and even there is no printed copy of contact, it doesn’t affect the validity and legal effect of electronic contract at all.
This pattern is somewhat similar to assembly line operation of “telemarketing ”, but buying insurance this way will also have a fatal problem, that is, the follow-up service may not keep up.
Insurance is usually a long-term contract that lasts for decades; when we buy insurance, shouldn’t we seriously consider whether the “intermediary ” we choose is an“ insurance intermediary ” who can accompany us for a long time and provide services to us many years later?
Then how can I contact the food delivery person?
It ’s almost three o’clock.
Then should you give me compensation?
I said to knock before handing me the delivery.
But the delivery person just left it at the door and left.
And got it wrong.
Your delivery person has picked up an order of mine at # NUMBER #, but I was told I still needed to wait.
The delivery person picked up my takeout at 19: 25, but still doesn’t want to set out.
I ’ll go buy it, and do you need any other takeout?
What do I do?
Where is your delivery person?
Do I still need to wait?
I asked for the food to be delivered.
Okay, if you don’t cancel it, I ’ll call the police.
But there will be safety and health issues in my food.

It will be okay after the discount code is reimbursed.
No problem, and remember not to arrange for a re-delivery, I have re-purchased it and I don’t want to cause any waste.
Thank you for your help.
I have been against any form of insult or abuse since the beginning, and I will not stand such personal attacks.
In this civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we need to get rid of these bullies.
If you don’t look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized actions that should be boycotted first.
I never replied to you since you started to send me Facebook friend request, published ridicule posts, and then tried to post the so-called location of my home and my father ’s name on social media.
After that, you made it worse by not only continuing to tag me six times a day, but also continuing to wantonly discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook about some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, my appearance, figure, shape fit for giving birth, getting love bites in bed, whether to penetrate or not, I... forget it.
It was unexpected that more people sent me a photo uploaded to your Facebook friends page and your harassing comments.
Sorry, I cannot be silent anymore as a girl.
After the news of me calling the police was published, you did not restrain yourself at all, but became more arrogant.
I don’t care about your political background or your identity or position; in our society, the two genders shall respect each other.
Yes, you can continue with your ridicule, obscure, humiliating and abusive remarks; you can continue to say that you just care about and pay attention to me; you can continue to think that this is not harassment; you can even continue to deny that you made the pictures or continue to make all the offensive remarks.
Yes, I can’t and won’t stop you.
I don’t know you and I don’t want to know you, and my appearance and body don’t need you judgement.
I don’t even think any girl would want to be famous by being humiliated like this.
My friends asked me if I was okay.
You won’t believe it if I say yes.
I don’t think any girl could say they are okay after being bullied like this.
No matter it ’s in the workplace, society, politics or the business world, only those without basic moral character will harm a woman in this way.
I believe justice is in everyone ’s heart.
I took screenshots of part of the comments and you can make your judgement.
You posted it yourself, and no one will pretend to be you, right?
I can only say you ’re the enemy of civilization.

Vietnamese People ’s Daily Website – Fan Mingzheng, the Prime Minister of the Vietnam Government, attended the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum
Two main conferences were held during the third Vietnam National Digital Technology Enterprise Development Forum, and discussions were held with two main topics, digital technology enterprises and national digital transformation, and digital technology enterprises and economic recovery and development during and after the epidemic.
According to Ruan Mengxiong, Minister of Communication and Media Department, in 2021, despite the continuous spreading of the epidemic, the quantity and operation revenue of Vietnamese digital technology enterprises kept increasing, with an increase rate of nearly 10%.
In 2021, the quantity of typical digital products of Vietnam solved various major difficulties Vietnam was facing; many digital products have walked out of the country, and the ranking of the digital technology in Vietnam has climbed up.
Minister Ruan Mengxiong appealed to digital technology enterprises to shoulder the responsibility as a platform to develop national digital transformation; undertaking the task of developing these national digital platforms is undertaking the mission of the country.
At the forum, leaders from various departments and government agencies as well as the enterprises, organizations and individuals engaged in research, development, application and transfer of digital technologies shared experience and advocated to pool resources from the whole society to develop technology enterprises in Vietnam, work together to promote digital transformation of the country, and seek breakthrough plans and solutions for economic recovery after the epidemic.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng emphasized at the forum that digital transformation is the only way for the world and the objective demand for development.
Digital transformation has become a global problem; digital transformation serves all the people, and therefore it is necessary to motivate all people to participate in it.
People and enterprises are the core, main subject, objective and motive power of digital transformation.
Therefore, all the policies shall be made for the people and enterprises.
As emphasized by Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng, digital transformation shall reflect national spirit, with internal force as the core, strategic, long-term and decisive factors, and external force as an important breakthrough.
He also believed at the same time that digital transformation should drive in-depth and sustainable development; it should participate in the prevention and control of COVID - 19, in economic recovery and development, cope with subsequent changes, overcome depletion of natural resources, assist in green transformation and develop green energy.
Digital transformation needs to participate in the protection and advocation of the setup of databases including national cultural values, historical traditions as well as local conditions and social customs, to promote digital transformation in fields such as banks, taxes, land management, database development and logistics.
The biggest goal of digital transformation is to make people happier and to make the country increasingly prosperous.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng required governments and institutions of various levels and enterprises to strengthen leadership and guidance in digital technology development, to improve awareness of digital transformation, continue to formulate and improve the system about digital transformation, strengthen national management, and to promote the development of digital technology enterprises in the spirit of respect, communication, listening and proactiveness.
During the forum, Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng attended the 2021 “Made in Vietnam ” excellent digital product awarding ceremony and the opening ceremony of“ Made in Vietnam ” digital product exposition.
I have reported it and attached the pictures, but there has been no reply.
What beef, I didn’t order beef.
It is Poached Chicken with Chili Sauce, and it ’s raw.
It ’s inedible.
Are you sure the food was freshly cooked and not from before?
That ’s unacceptable.
I ’ve placed the order very early.
It said it would be de delivered a little over seven o’clock.
Why does it have to be re-made?
It ’s ridiculous.

HSR Easyhome
Address: HSR North One Road 555 View Map
Home appliances in this store are quite complete, with many brands including almost all well-known brands.
During the Double 12 Sale, I went to the "Hunsdon" water purifier store to see the water purifiers, and there were sale activities in the store with favorable prices.
There are 11 floors in Easyhome, from B2 to 9th floor, in which B2 and B2 are for parking and parking is free during the day!
The surroundings are really not nice, with few restaurants and hardware store, and the food there tasted average.
This elevator really makes people speechless; it went back and forth from B2 to B1 and did not stop on my floor, and it was ridiculous that when I went to the 1st floor from fire escape, it led to a furniture store which was closed, so I couldn’t get out from the fire escape, either!

Full coverage of on-water green comprehensive service areas has been realized in the main stream of the Yangtze River - Xinhuanet
Message from Wuhan Xinhua News Agency on December 11 (Reporter: Wang Xian): Chongqing Fuling on-water green comprehensive service area was completed on schedule and put into operation on December 10, which was the 2nd on-water green comprehensive service area officially put into operation on the upper reaches of Yangtze River after the Sichuan Luzhou water green comprehensive service area started operation on December 8.
Up until now, on-water green comprehensive service areas have covered the upper reaches, the middle reaches and the lower reaches of Yangtze River.
According to introduction from Qiu Jianhua, deputy director general of Yangtze Navigation Administration Bureau of Ministry of Transport, before that, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui and Jiangsu had constructed and put into use 10 on-water green comprehensive service areas in the middle reaches and the lower reaches of Yangtze River, which had been recognized by sailors and had played an important role in promoting high-quality development of shipping in the Yangtze River.
Full coverage of on-water green comprehensive service areas is another milestone event for the construction of green shipping of the Yangtze River, which has greatly improved the abilities of pollutant collection and shipping services of the Yangtze River.
As introduced, on-water green comprehensive service areas are important facilities that provide ships and sailors with comprehensive production and living services, and help them solve “emergent and difficult ” problems.
The two newly established on-water green comprehensive service areas in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are integrated with life services, production services and government services; with environmental protection as the theme and ship repair and emergency rescue services as the features, they realize “multiple services at an anchoring ” along the shore, providing sailors working in the Yangtze River all year long with more efficient work and more convenient life.
Three US aircraft carriers assemble around China; the most powerful weapons visit Guam in rare situation 2022 - 01 - 17 multidimensional Pro Communist media multidimensionally reports: latest news on China US Relation: the latest satellite image showed that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; US media also disclosed that one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy ’s arsenal in a rare case visited Guam, and sent an important signal to US allies and enemies in the Indo-Pacific region.
According to Chinese think-tank “South China Sea Strategic Situation Detection Platform ”, on January 9, the satellite found the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier from the US army near the Balabac Strait.
Connecting the South China Sea and Sulu Sea, the Balabac Strait is a strategic place on the first island chain in the Western Pacific.
The platform predicts that Carl Vinson will do deployment at the South China Sea.
This will be the first time that Carl Vinson carries F - 35C fighter and CMV - 22 Osprey carrier transport aircraft to do the deployment.
In addition to Carl Vinson, the US aircraft carriers cruising in the Pacific Ocean now also include the USS Abraham Lincoln, which departed from the United States on January 3.
USS Abraham Lincoln also carried the F - 35C carrier based aircraft squadron for the first time, which belongs to the 314th Fighter Attack Squadron of the US Marine Corps.
Apart from the above two aircraft carriers, the US Navy currently also deploys the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier, which is docked in Yokosuka, Japan, in the Asia Pacific region.
The aircraft carrier battle group also includes the missile cruiser “Champlain Lake ” and guided missile destroyer“ Stockdale ”.
Three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; the most powerful weapon paid a visit to Guam in a rare case; on January 17, 2022, the “South China Sea Strategic Situation Detection Platform ” released the latest satellite images, showing that three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China.
(Weibo @ SouthChinaSeaStrategicSituationDetection) three US aircraft carriers assembled around China; the most powerful weapon paid a visit to Guam in a rare case; on January 17, 2022, the flight route of the US carrier-borne transport aircraft CMV - 22B.
(Weibo @ SouthChinaSeaStrategicSituationDetection) According to report of CNN on January 17, one of the most powerful weapons in the US Navy arsenal paid a visit to Guam in a rare case.
The Ohio class nuclear submarine USS Nevada, which carries 20 Trident ballistic missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, entered the US naval base in Guam last Saturday (January 15).
Three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; the most powerful weapon paid a visit to Guam in a rare case; according to analysis, this is a signal to allies and enemies in the increasingly tense situation in the Indo-Pacific region.
This is the first visit to Guam by a US ballistic missile submarine since 2016 and the second public visit to Guam since the 1980s.
Three US aircraft carriers are assembling around China; the most powerful weapon paid a visit to Guam in a rare case; China has built a large number of military facilities in the Nansha Islands in recent years.
The picture shows China ’s Yongshu Island in the Nansha Islands.
(South China Sea Research Forum) the U.S. Navy said in a statement that the visit of the Ohio class nuclear submarine “Nevada ” to Guam strengthened the cooperation between the US and its allies in the region, demonstrated the ability, flexibility, combat readiness of the US, as well as its continued commitment to security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.
Ballistic missile submarines are often called “Boomer submarines ”.
The whereabouts of the 14 “Boomer Submarines ” in the US Navy fleet are usually strictly confidential.
The secret surrounding ballistic missile submarines makes “Boomer Submarine" the “most important survival weapon in the Nuclear Trinity ”; this system also includes launching silo ballistic missile located in the US, as well as bombers such as B - 2 and B - 52 that can carry nuclear warheads.
I talked to my friend about the recent 26% plunge in Meta and its loss of US $251 billion in market value; Zuckerberg responded that he was “facing unprecedented competition ”; why?
Meta (formerly Facebook) is essentially an advertising company, whose revenue mainly comes from advertising; the advertising company that makes money today has its own channel for traffic.
Regardless of its function positioning, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc. are all channels of traffic for Meta.
Not only that, Meta is also the biggest “advertisement alliance ”; Many apps are externally connected to Meta ’s advertising, and they achieve realization through Meta ’s advertising platform.
But, the time has changed.
First, due to the adjustment of Apple ’s privacy policy, it is difficult for Meta to get users ’ data information now, which affects the efficiency of advertising.
Apple ’s current privacy policy is very user-friendly; it will use explicit prompt to ask users whether they allow apps to access their own information; most people ’s normal reaction is definitely not to allow it.
If Google stabs again next, it will have a greater impact on Meta ’s revenue.
Second, the Chinese factor in Meta ’s revenue growth has also been weakened (the proportion of this factor is uncertain, but it does exist).
We all know that Meta doesn’t have business in China, but this understanding is not accurate.
At least 10% of Meta ’s revenue comes from China every year, mainly contributed by Chinese companies engaged in offshore business.
There are around hundreds of staff at its Hong Kong office and several major agents in the mainland.
When Chinese companies want to expand overseas market, Meta is an advertising channel that cannot be bypassed, and so most of the money is given to Meta.
Interestingly, the TT of ByteDance now is one of Meta ’s main competitors, but Meta made a lot of money from ByteDance in the past two years.
All domestic agents are helping ByteDance to do advertising at Meta, and Meta ’s performance in Greater China is also very good.
I haven’t specifically learned about it recently, but it ’s definitely not better than before.
The stage when Chinese companies were burning money overseas on a large scale has passed.
Third, the expansion of new traffic channels is not smooth.
Facebook is getting older, and new platforms including TT is not in the hands of Meta.
The biggest problem is not the decline of revenue but lack of growth expectation.
The capital market not only focuses on income; more importantly, it depends on future expectations.
Obviously, the expectation for Meta is not enough.
In order to tell new stories to the market, Zuckerberg told the story about “Meta-universe ”.
Meta-universe indeed should be one of the future directions, but the period of the realization of Meta-universe is long, and this story is not sufficient to support the market value of Meta.
Therefore, the next two years should be a difficult time for Meta.
Although Facebook is very popular now with an annual income of US $100 billion to $200 billion; in fact, Facebook has a strong sense of crisis; compared with other Internet companies and high-tech companies, there is not any good security moat.
Although the DAU of several of his social software is relatively high, and they are mainstream social software such as Facebook, WhatsApp; however, in the face of the rapid development of TikTok, Facebook has little confidence, and subversion could happen in the blink of an eye.
The unattainable concept of meta universe has no hope of success in a short time, so Facebook is in danger; this is also the fundamental reason why Zuckerberg changed the name of the company and kept looking for new tracks, but I think his choice is wrong and there is no way back; the above is some of my thoughts for reference.

Dominic Raab: Government can't make apologies for Spain quarantine decision
Dominic Raab has defended the Government's decision to re-introduce quarantine measures on Spain at short notice.
Ministers announced on Saturday that holidaymakers who had not returned from Spain and its islands by midnight would be forced to self-isolate for 14 days.
The country had been on a list of "travel corridor" nations deemed safe to visit by Downing Street, but a recent surge in coronavirus cases has sparked fears of a second wave of the disease.
On Sunday, the Foreign Secretary defended the sudden reimposition of restrictions as a "real-time response" to a worrying spike in infections reported in the region.
He said the situation was then assessed yesterday afternoon "and we took the decision as swiftly as we could."
"We can't make apologies for doing so," he added.
"We must be able to take swift, decisive action, particularly in relation to localised, or internationally in relation to Spain or a particular country, where we see we must take action."
"Otherwise, we risk re-infection into the UK, potentially a second wave here and then another lockdown."
Transport secretary among Spain holidaymakers forced to quarantine
The decision was made after Spain recorded more than 900 new daily Covid - 19 cases for two days running.
The Foreign Secretary acknowledged that many tourists had been left with no time to cancel or alter their plans.
"I understand it is disruptive for those going through this who are in Spain or have been considering going but we must be able to take swift, decisive action to protect the UK," he said.
"We've made such progress in getting the virus down and preventing the virus re-taking hold in the UK."
Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth condemned the Government for its "frankly shambolic" handling of the measure.
He said Downing Street's sudden decision had left holidaymakers "confused and distressed."
The Labour MP told Sophy Ridge: "I understand why they've made the decision but, of course, the way in which this decision has been made in the last 24 hours is frankly shambolic.
"There are holidaymakers in Spain at the moment confused and distressed, there are people about to go on holiday to Spain and the islands like Tenerife who are confused, and they don't know whether their employers will allow them to take two weeks" quarantine.
"The Government is just saying," we hope that employers co-operate. ""
"The way in which this decision has been made in the last 24 hours is frankly shambolic."
What does Spain being on quarantine list mean for holidaymakers?
He urged ministers to offer "clarity" on whether those who are asked to quarantine will receive financial support if their employers refuse to pay them during the quarantine period.
He added that clear information was also needed "for those holidaymakers who are currently in Spain who have properly saved up all year for their family holiday who are confused and distressed."
"The way in which this decision has been communicated is obviously causing anxiety," he stressed.
Mr Raab said no worker following the new guidance should be penalised by employers, including by being put onto sick pay.
He said: "We are changing the rules - the law is changed in relation to holidaymakers and travellers - and of course we expect employers to show those employees who will have to quarantine because of the law the flexibility they need.
"If someone is following the law in relation to quarantine and self-isolating the way they should, they can't have penalties taken against them."
US "failures" are holding back search for coronavirus drugs
The global effort to produce useful anti-Covid medicines is being hampered by the US because researchers are testing drugs in "an arbitrary, willy-nilly way," the expert leading the UK's programme has warned.
Britain's Recovery Trial programme, which has involved 12,000 patients at several hundred British hospitals, has already pinpointed one promising new drug to tackle the disease and also highlighted two others - previously thought to be potential life-savers - as being useless.
But the failure of the US medical system to match this output has meant that other promising treatments that could have been cleared for widespread use have still to be evaluated.
In particular, convalescent plasma (blood plasma that is taken from Covid - 19 patients and which contains antibodies that could protect others against the disease) has still to be properly tested on a large-scale randomised trial.
"Tens of thousands of people have already been given convalescent plasma in the US but these treatments were not randomised," said Professor Martin Landray, one of the founders of the Recovery programme.
"They just give individuals convalescent plasma in the hope it will work. Vast quantities have been given and they still have no idea whether it helps or harms or has no impact," added Landray, an expert in the setting up of large-scale drug trials.
The US is failing to do large, randomised trials and that ends up providing bad medicine
Randomised drug trials are the gold standard for pinpointing useful medicines.
They remove unconscious biases that might cloud clinicians' judgments.
Thousands of people are given a drug and thousands of others are given a placebo.
No one knows which they have been given.
Then results are compared and the efficacy of the treatment revealed.
In this way, Recovery was able to demonstrate that the steroid dexamethasone reduced deaths by a third in Covid - 19 patients on ventilators.
It also showed that the much-hyped drug hydroxychloroquine - as well as the combined therapy of the drugs lopinavir and ritonavir - had no effect in saving patients' lives.
Crucially these trials needed very large numbers of patients and no single hospital has enough for such research.
Britain has had one key advantage - a centralised National Health Service.
By contrast, the US health service is fragmented and its only success in pointing a possible treatment has been highlighting the usefulness of the highly expensive drug remdesivir for speeding recovery of some Covid - 19 patients.
"There are lots and lots of small drugs trials involving a few dozen or a few hundred patients going on in the US but nothing of any substance," added Landray.
"They are failing to do large, randomised trials and that ends up providing bad medicine. It makes the practice of medicine poorer and the outcomes for patients poorer."
Landray said this failure was particularly exasperating when it came to the use of convalescent plasma, which many doctors believe could have a key role to play in treating seriously ill Covid - 19 patients.
"If you look at the US, huge quantities of this treatment have been used on an arbitrary willy-nilly basis. The UK excels beyond measure compared with what's going on there," he added.
Professor Peter Horby, an expert on infectious diseases and the other founder of the Recovery programme, said:
"There have been reports of 20,000 patients getting convalescent plasma in a cohort but none of those patients were randomised. If they had put these patients into randomised trials, we would now have a clear answer about the effectiveness of convalescent plasma."
Horby added that UK Recovery has now launched a randomised trial of convalescent plasma but does not expect results to be ready until later this year.
Salmonella outbreak sickens 212 people in 23 states
July 25 (UPI) - - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating an outbreak of salmonella that has sickened 212 people in 23 states.
In a Friday press release the CDC reported that 87 people had become ill since its last update on the outbreak Tuesday.
The agency said people began showing symptoms linked to a strain of salmonella, which can take two to four weeks to manifest symptoms, between June 19 and July 11.
Thirty-one people have been hospitalized since the outbreak began, but no fatalities have been reported.
According to the CDC, a specific source for the salmonella strain has not been identified.
It has not issued any advisement against eating or consuming particular foods, nor named retailers that might be selling contaminated products.
Oregon has had the most cases of salmonella, with 51 infections, with Utah following close behind with 40 reported cases.
Salmonella is a bacterial, foodborne illness that causes 1.35 million infections, 26,500 hospitalizations, and 420 deaths each year, according to the CDC.
The most common symptoms of salmonella infection are diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps, which can begin between six hours and six days after exposure.
The illness usually lasts four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment, but some cases require hospitalization.
Couple MACED at California dog park for not wearing face masks while having lunch (VIDEO) - RT USA News
There's mask-shaming and then there's full on assault.
A California couple having lunch with their puppy at a dog park experienced the second, when an irate woman pepper-sprayed them for refusing to mask up... while eating.
Ash O'Brien and husband Jarett Kelley say they were grabbing a bite to eat at Dusty Rhodes dog park in San Diego on Thursday, with their three-month - old pug in tow.
The pair had their masks off to eat, when a "random old lady" approached, calling them "idiots" for not masking up, even though "you can't wear a mask and eat at the same time."
O'Brien told the woman to leave the park and stop harassing her, at which point the woman unleashed a can of mace at the couple.
Video footage captured by a bystander begins with Kelley wrestling the spray can from the woman, and getting a dose of mace into the face for his troubles.
O'Brien can be heard crying in the background as the attacker walks away with her dogs.
O'Brien shared the video on Facebook and told ABC 10 that she wants to see the woman "go to jail."
Face masks are mandatory across the state of California, even in fresh air.
These masks can only be removed at a select few times, including when eating or drinking.
However, nowhere in the state's coronavirus guidelines does it say that bystanders may use non-lethal weapons to enforce this policy.
Even in the current era of "mask-shaming," that's still a crime carrying a penalty of a fine of $1,000 or up to three years in a state prison.
Flat, Free Education For Indore Egg Seller Paras Raykar Whose Cart Was Overturned Allegedly Over Rs. 100 Bribe
Paras Raykar's cart carrying eggs was allegedly overturned Thursday by the civic officials in Indore.
Two days after the story of a 13 - year-old egg seller's cart being overturned by civic officials went viral on social media, the Indore-based boy has found overwhelming support from people across the country, helping them recover from the losses and manage to start their business again.
The boy's family also claimed that politicians including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal have reached out to them and offered support.
The boy's family also received a flat and offer to take care of the educational expenses of the children in the family.
Paras Raykar's cart carrying eggs was allegedly overturned Thursday by the civic officials in Indore, where the administration has implemented the "left-right" rule for the staggered opening of shops amid the coronavirus pandemic.
A video in which the boy alleged that the officials had warned him in the morning to remove his cart or pay Rs 100 as bribe had gone viral on social media.
When he refused, the officials tipped his cart over, destroying all the eggs, the boy alleged.
The boy had also claimed that his daily sale has been down due to the pandemic and the loss of his stock will put additional financial burden on him, in the video.
Since Thursday, the boy's family has been overwhelmed with support from people across the country, many of them offering help in both cash and kind.
The family has also received help from locals.
While former chief minister Digvijaya Singh has offered financial support and help to get the children admitted in a college, BJP MLA from Indore, Ramesh Mendola, has assured to provide a house under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana to the child.
Indore Press Club has also provided ration and money to the boy.
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's office and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has also offered help.
"We are overwhelmed by the support from people across the country.
(BJP MLA) Ramesh Mendola has assured a flat under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.
He has also provided a cycle and Rs 2,500.
Digvijaya Singh has provided Rs 10,000 and assurance to look after the education of the two children.
Rahul Gandhi's office has also called and offered support.
A woman from Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal called and offered help.
Jyothiraditya Scindia has also offered support, "Paras's grandfather said.
Home Secretary Priti Patel demands explanation from Twitter and Instagram over 'abhorrent' Wiley tweets
Priti Patel has demanded an explanation from Twitter and Instagram over the length of time it took to remove "abhorrent" posts made by Wiley.
Police are currently investigating a series of antisemitic comments posted on the Grime artist's social media accounts.
The Home Secretary tweeted on Sunday: "The antisemitic posts from Wiley are abhorrent.
"They should not have been able to remain on Twitter and Instagram for so long and I have asked them for a full explanation.
"Social media companies must act much faster to remove such appalling hatred from their platforms."
Twitter was accused of "ignoring antisemitism" as Wiley's tweets were still visible 12 hours after they were first posted.
A number of tweets have since been removed and the 41 - year-old has been issued a seven-day ban by the site.
Twitter previously said Wiley's account had been temporarily locked "for violating our hateful conduct policy," while Facebook said there was "no place for hate speech on Instagram."
The Metropolitan Police said on Saturday: "The Met takes all reports of antisemitism extremely seriously. The relevant material is being assessed."
Meanwhile, Wiley's management company, A-List Management, "cut all ties" with the star.
The artist's now former manager, John Woolf, who is Jewish, wrote on Twitter: "Following Wiley's antisemitic tweets today we at @ A _ ListMGMT have cut all ties with him. There is no place in society for antisemitism."
He had earlier said he did not support or condone what Wiley posted but that he would speak to him privately and "help educate him."
However, in a video on Instagram, Wiley appeared to say it was him who had cut ties with his management.
Other MPs criticised Twitter for allowing the tweets to remain visible.
Labour MP Jess Phillips said on Saturday: "Just seen all the Wiley stuff. Why on earth have @ Twitter left up such blatant antisemitism and hatred? It hits all the dangerous beats, Jews get things you don't get, they are in control, they think their better... This is dangerous stuff. Surely it should come down."
Fellow MP Neil Coyle added: "His management appear able to act quicker than @ Twitter emphasising, once again, that legislation (including the Online Harms Bill) should ensure social media platforms are not used to spread hate."
John Mann, the government's independent adviser on antisemitism, said the tweets "demonstrated precisely why the law needs changing to hold them to reasonable account."
Meanwhile, the Campaign Against Antisemitism asked police to investigate Wiley's content and called on his social media accounts to be shut down "to prevent further outpouring of anti-Jewish venom."
Wiley, known as the Godfather of Grime and whose real name is Richard Cowie, received an MBE for services to music in 2018.
Kudlow says next coronavirus stimulus bill will include more checks, extend moratorium on evictions
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow promised on Sunday that the federal government will extend the moratorium on evictions and send out another round of checks as part of the next coronavirus stimulus package.
Kudlow's comments come after a week where the White House's hoped for payroll tax cuts were shot down by Congress.
"There's a $1,200 check coming. That is going to be part of the new package. I would have preferred a payroll tax cut, on top of that check," Kudlow said on CNN's "State of the Union.
"But, be that as it may, politically, it doesn't work."
While no deal has been officially announced, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows have been on Capitol Hill recently to discuss the details of a new relief package with congressional leaders.
On ending the additional $600 in unemployment benefits the federal government was supplying, Kudlow argued that the extra money was hurting small businesses from hiring workers.
"We have had a flood of inquiries and phone calls and complaints that small stores and businesses, restaurants can't hire people back," he said.
"They went too far. Maybe last March, it was necessary for that, but, really, there are consequences of people not returning to work."
Mnuchin earlier in the day on "Fox News Sunday" said it a little more bluntly: "I think workers and Americans understand the concept that you shouldn't be paid more to stay home than to work."
Mnuchin said the new bill will provide additional unemployment benefits, but noted that it will be less than the payments issued under the CARES Act.
He said some workers were collecting more than they earned on the job.
As a result, when businesses were reopening some employees did not have an incentive to return to work.
The secretary said the Trump administration and Senate Republicans are on the same page with a $1 trillion package, but noted that in the interest of passing a bill quickly, issues that are more difficult to negotiate with Democrats could be held off for another bill.

Egypt court refers man who murdered three children to psychiatric evaluation
The South Minya Prosecution's Attorney General Tamer Motea on Sunday sentenced a farmer to four days imprisonment pending investigations into why he murdered his three children while also referring him to a psychiatric committee.
On July 24, 56 - year-old Mohamed Ali threw his children Khadiga, four, Mena, eight, and Omar, six, in front of a moving train at the Mallawi Railway Station.
Ali was found to be babbling incoherently during investigations, leading to suspicion he was suffering a mental breakdown.
His wife denied she had suffered any problems with him and attributed his behavior to psychological issues.
Villagers from Massart Mallawi refrained from speaking about the incident, offering only their condolences to the children's family.
Roughly 93 percent of Egyptian children aged one to 14 years old suffer from violence, said Khalid Darwish, advisor to the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood back in October.
Prosecution is one of the most important pillars in eliminating child abuse, he added, stressing the importance of cooperation between the council and Public Prosecution in this regard.
According to a study prepared by the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood, children are subjected to violence in places that are supposed to be safe, such as home, school or clubs, and exposed to violence from people who are supposed to care for them, such as parents or teachers.
AP blasts White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany for "political" briefings - but reporters keep asking political questions - RT USA News
The Associated Press has accused White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany of worrying the media by making her briefings political rather than informational - - apparently forgetting that reporters choose the questions.
An article Saturday by the AP, the largest US news agency, said White House press briefings may be a "broken tradition," as McEnany has made them "a streamlined, full-throated advertisement for a president facing re-election, a venue for attacks on the media and a forum relatively light on information" about what the government is doing.
The last of those assertions is indisputable, as hardly any new information is revealed at the briefings.
What the AP failed to mention is that hardly any new information is actually sought at the briefings.
Reporters frequently use White House pressers to draw attention to themselves, an art form perfected by CNN's Jim Acosta.
They go beyond the typical adversarial media-administration relationship, repeating each other in asking gotcha questions aimed only at impugning President Donald Trump.
In some cases, they make themselves the news, such as when CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang responded to an "ask China" retort from Trump by making a not-so - subtle hint at racism: "Sir, why are you saying that to me specifically?"
A July 6 briefing offered a prime example of the disconnect over how the briefings have ceased to be a source of meaningful information for Americans.
Trump tweeted that morning that NASCAR's television ratings had been hurt by a false allegation of a hate crime against driver Bubba Wallace and by its decision to ban display of the Confederate flag at its events.
Predictably, most of the questions were about the tweet as reporter after reporter asked McEnany questions designed to prompt her to say that Trump supports the Confederate flag.
McEnany didn't provide the answer reporters wanted - a sound bite that would hurt Trump - but she repeatedly responded by saying the president wasn't taking a position on the Confederate flag and that the gist of his message was that NASCAR fans were wrongly being portrayed as being racist.
The AP said she sounded "exasperated" during the briefing.
The AP's story echoed a Washington Post op-ed column earlier this month by ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl, who also is president of the White House Correspondents Association.
Karl argued, "denying reality and using the White House podium for purely political purposes is a violation of public trust."
Yet McEnany's quick wit and combative style have made her a hero of some Trump supporters, since she gave her first briefing on May 1 after taking over as press secretary in April.
The pressers had been absent for more than a year before her appointment.
Like other aspects of political life in Washington, the White House press secretary's relationship with the media has changed dramatically in the Trump era.
That change has come from both sides and predated McEnany's arrival.
A roast of former press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders by comedian Michelle Wolf at the White House Correspondents "dinner in April 2018 was so vicious that even MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski called it" deplorable. "
AP White House reporter Jill Colvin greeted McEnany at her first briefing by asking, "Will you pledge never to lie to us from that podium?"
Fox News political analyst Brit Hume, a veteran of more than 50 years in journalism who had a 1989 - 1996 stint as ABC's chief White House correspondent, said reporters today display "aggressive behavior" in the briefing room because of their contempt for Trump.
It is because of their anti-Trump focus, he said this week on Fox's Tucker Carlson Tonight program, journalists are neglecting to gather policy news.
"It's not just a gotcha game," Hume said of the intended purpose of the pressers.
"It's not just an attempt to embarrass a public official. It's to extract information.
Courthouse set on fire during protest in California
OAKLAND, Ca. - - Protesters in California set fire to a courthouse, damaged a police station and assaulted officers after a peaceful demonstration intensified late Saturday, Oakland police said.
Demonstrators broke windows, spray painted graffiti, shot fireworks and pointed lasers at officers, the Oakland department said on Twitter.
Several tweets called for peace and asked organizers to "help us provide safe spaces and safe places for demonstrators."
The protest began earlier Saturday evening with groups such as the "Wall of Moms," similar to a group that formed in Portland, Oregon, as protesters faced off with U.S. agents deployed to that city to guard a federal courthouse.
President Donald Trump had sent the federal agents to clamp down on protests that have occurred nightly since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25.
The protest in Oakland began peacefully, but turned violent later into the night.
An "unlawful assembly" was declared by police around 11: 30 p.m. and officers asked the crowd to disperse.
The fire broke out at the Alameda County Superior Courthouse and was contained a short time later, news outlets reported.
Police said protesters at one point were "breaking windows and chanting racial slurs at residents."
Photos tweeted by the department showed broken glass and paint splattered at a police building.
Senior UN official skips Pakistan visit, citing flight issue
ISLAMABAD (AP) - The incoming president of the United Nations General Assembly announced Sunday that he was postponing a scheduled visit to Pakistan "due to some technical flight problems."
Turkish diplomat Volkan Bozkir was elected president of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly last month and was scheduled to arrive in Islamabad on Sunday.
But in a Twitter post, he said the visit to Pakistan's capital would have to wait.
Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi tweeted in response to Bozkir that "I look forward to welcoming you to Pakistan soon for a constructive and fruitful visit."
A day earlier, a jubilant Qureshi, while announcing the visit, had hoped he would discuss a range of issues with Bozkir, including Kashmir, which is split between Pakistan and neighboring India and claimed by both in its entirety.
Pakistan and India have fought two of their three wars over the disputed region since gaining independence from British rule in 1947.
The two sides often exchange fire in Kashmir, causing troops and civilian casualties on both sides.
Pakistan wants the United Nations to play its role in resolving the issue of Kashmir under its resolutions by allowing people living in the Himalayan region to decide whether they want to merge with India, with Pakistan or whether they prefer independence.
Paul Pogba drops hint over his future after Man Utd seal Champions League spot
Manchester United star Paul Pogba has suggested he will stay at the club this summer after the Red Devils sealed a place in the top four.
A 2 - 0 win against Leicester meant United finished in third, ahead of Frank Lampard's Chelsea.
United were 14 points off Leicester just 12 matches ago but a sensational run of form saw the Red Devils finish in the top four.
Pogba had been expected to leave the club this summer after twice requesting to leave in the last two years.
However, the pandemic means few clubs will be spending big this summer and there's not a buyer available that could combine a transfer fee and Pogba's salary to entice him away from Old Trafford.
That clarification has helped Pogba in recent weeks as his performances, as well as his body language, have improved.
And the Frenchman has dropped the latest hint that he's set to stay at the club by posting on his Instagram after his side's 2 - 0 win.
While Pogba may have been simply celebrating the club's return to the competition, many fans are interpreting it as a strong suggestion that he'll still be at the club as they compete with Europe's best again.
Pogba has a year to run on his existing deal, though the club can extend that by 12 months meaning he effectively has two years to run.
United are keen on extending Pogba's deal and they want clarity over his situation before next season.
Pogba, for his part, feels comfortable at the club and has been buoyed by the arrival of Bruno Fernandes.
The Portuguese playmaker has been a revelation at Old Trafford and his arrival has allowed Pogba to play in a deeper central midfield position, which has also improved his mood.
Watford relegated from Premier League as Aubameyang fires Arsenal win
Some of Watford's players sank to their knees; others made for the tunnel without a moment's delay.
The whistle had just blown on their five years in the Premier League and nobody could say that, when the occasion demanded them to hurl the kitchen sink at Arsenal, they went down without a fight.
This was a performance full of the crispness, urgency and aggression that have hallmarked their best work over the last half-decade but it came too late, as did the fightback that almost completely overhauled a three-goal deficit on the day.
Had Emiliano Martínez not brilliantly saved Danny Welbeck's backheel 16 minutes from time, shortly after his former teammate had tapped in to put Watford within two goals of safety, there is every chance they could have completed a comeback for the ages.
In the end they fell short and their caretaker manager, Hayden Mullins, might reflect that he would have never been handed this most thankless of tasks if his team had shown comparable application previously.
Across the season they have not been good enough, but then nor has the organisation that employs them.
One poor campaign may not wreck an empire, but nor do the foundations put in place by the Pozzo family offer any kind of guarantee they will sail straight back up from the second tier.
It is hard to escape the sense that Watford's habit of flipping managers has run out of road.
Their next permanent - perhaps in the loosest sense of - appointment will be the 12th in eight years and there is only so much fresh air a new broom can sweep in.
Troy Deeney faces up to relegation despite getting on the scoresheet at the Emirates.
Players will depart, Ismaïla Sarr showing again here that it should be inconceivable he will be playing Championship football in September, and a steady hand should be a priority.
There was nothing stable about the boom-or - bust fare in an encounter Mikel Arteta described as "a bit of a basketball game," although it certainly made for fine entertainment.
Arteta said afterwards Watford's forwards had been "cheating," although he quickly clarified that as a football term for "gambling, staying up front."
They certainly needed to: any suggestion a battling point might eventually suffice was quickly scotched and they might wonder how things would have transpired if they had not been obliged to play catch-up.
Instead they conceded a penalty almost immediately.
Craig Dawson had bundled carelessly into Alexandre Lacazette within 40 seconds but it took VAR almost three minutes to be confident of awarding the spot kick, which Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang dispatched unfussily.
Watford gathered themselves to press relentlessly, with Sarr in electric form on the right, and came close through Roberto Pereyra and Troy Deeney.
But then Aubameyang teed up Kieran Tierney for a deflected second and, at the first drinks break, the game had been so oddly skewed that Arteta was the manager tearing a strip off his players despite Arsenal's advantage.
Aubameyang then controlled Tierney's long throw and converted a masterful overhead kick that left him one goal short of the golden boot, an award he would have shared with Jamie Vardy if Ben Foster had not blocked one last chance near the end.
Watford appeared done for but they persevered and, after David Luiz had produced another rash penalty-area challenge for the album on Welbeck, Deeney rammed in his own penalty before the break.
Deeney, walking wounded for most of the season, hauled himself around the pitch and was in gladiator mode throughout.
He would probably have gobbled up the chance Adam Masina missed early in the second period and further openings were spurned, too.
Welbeck was thwarted for a first time by the excellent Martínez, who Arteta confirmed will start Saturday's FA Cup final, and then had the entire Watford contingent pitchside on their feet upon converting a fizzing cross from Sarr.
But Watford's prospects faded when his next effort was repelled and the soul-searching, from top to bottom, will need to be extensive.
Famously clear Lake Tahoe has been polluted by climate change
South Lake Tahoe, California - Despite the pandemic, even on a weekday, people still crowd Pope Beach at Lake Tahoe.
"I like camping and having a bike ride and going swimming at the Lake," said one girl named Dakota.
"This is something beautiful everybody wants to visit," said Emerica Benitas.
Which is why Matt Meunier's dive business is still going strong, even in a pandemic.
He says he sees "exceptional clarity. Lake Tahoe is the cleanest, most wonderful lake, I think, in the country."
Now the bad news: Lake Tahoe's not as clean, not as clear, as it used to be when he moved here over two decades ago.
"The thing that we're noticing more and more is down on the rocks," Meunier said.
"You're getting this strange algae on the rocks."
Climate change, scientists believe, has affected the water temperature and thus, the clarity.
And 15 million people visit the lake annually - along with the garbage they leave.
Meunier said dive trips to clean up the bottom of the lake found old trash.
"And when I say old trash, I mean '60s,' 70s," Meunier said.
"Beer cans, soda cans, church key cans from the old days."
Scientists monitor the clarity of Lake Tahoe every year by dropping a white disc, then measuring how far down they can see it.
UC Davis professor Geoff Schladow said it's an "important indicator of how healthy the lake is."
When it was measured last year, the clarity of the lake was about 80 feet.
That means you can see that disc 80 feet down.
But, consider this, about 20 years ago, the clarity of lake was 100 feet.
That's the trend scientists are trying to reverse.
But they're fighting the impacts of climate change, development around the lake and something added to the lake in the 1960's: A tiny invasive shrimp brought in to feed the fish.
It didn't work.
"Once the shrimp came in, there were suddenly no natural cleaners in the lake," Schladow said.
Similar challenges are facing lakes and bodies of water around the world.
"The lesson here is, if you can't do it at Tahoe, then what hope is there for all the rivers and estuaries, streams and lakes around the country that are never going to have the same degree of attention, the same level of resources?" Schladow said.
Meunier said he is "hopeful" because "if there's a silver lining of our pandemic, I think it showed that nature will come back and heal itself if we just relieved that pressure, that human pressure, off of it and allow it to happen. There's facts there now."
QB Herbert among 4 draft picks signed by Chargers
COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) - The Los Angeles Chargers have signed four of their draft picks, including quarterback Justin Herbert, and have agreed to terms with the other two members of their draft class.
The Chargers were able to get contracts done with their draft class on Saturday when they reported to training camp for physicals and equipment.
Along with Herbert, who was selected with the sixth overall pick, the team announced the signings of wide receivers Joe Reed (fifth round) and KJ Hill (seventh round) along with sixth-round safety Alohi Gilman.
They have agreed to terms with first-round linebacker Kenneth Murray Jr. and running back Joshua Kelley, who was selected in the fourth round.
Herbert started 42 games at Oregon, compiling a 29 - 13 record with 10,541 passing yards and 108 total touchdowns.
He led the Ducks to the Pac - 12 championship last season, throwing 32 touchdowns and six interceptions in 14 games.
He capped his career with a win over Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl, where he ran for three touchdowns and was named the offensive MVP.
Herbert will compete with veteran Tyrod Taylor for the starting job.
The Chargers will have a new quarterback after Philip Rivers departed via free agency after 14 seasons as the starter.
Murray was the 23rd overall pick after Los Angeles traded with New England to move back into the first round.
He was a third-team Associated Press All-America selection selection last season after leading the Sooners with 102 tackles, including 69 solo.
Barcelona 'have whole side to sell' this summer as Coutinho, Dembele, Rakitic and Vidal all listed for transfers
BARCELONA will be known as a selling club this summer, according to reports.
No fewer than 12 first team stars have been transfer-listed by the La Liga giants, claim Marca.
Philippe Coutinho has been reportedly transfer-listed by Barcelona
And those include Premier League targets Philippe Coutinho, Ousmane Dembele, Ivan Rakitic and Samuel Umtiti.
Coutinho and Umtiti have both been linked with moves to Arsenal, with the Brazilian also being eyed up by Chelsea.
While Manchester United and Tottenham are said to be in a battle for Rakitic's services.
French World Cup winner Dembele, who has struggled for game time at the Camp Nou, was recently linked with a move to PSG in a swap deal with Neymar.
The other players who are deemed surplus to requirements include Neto, Nelson Semedo, Junior Firpo, Arturo Vidal, Martin Braithwaite, Carles Alena, Rafinha Alcantara, and Jean-Clair Todibo.
Barcelona are hoping a clear out will not only boost their finances, but aid their future transfer business.
Ousmane Dembele is also said to be surplus to requirements
According to the Spanish newspaper, Barcelona have already identified their transfer targets for next season - with Argentinian forward Lautaro Martinez top of their hit list.
But Inter Milan are continuing to ask for his £101million release clause to be met before negotiating with the Catalans.
Barcelona will have to sell before they can buy, but remain confident that they can strike a deal with the Serie A side.

Car drives through crowd, protester shot in Colorado
AURORA, Colo. (AP) - A car drove through a crowd and a protester was shot in the suburban Denver suburb of Aurora during demonstrations against racial injustice.
The Aurora Police Department said on Twitter that protesters were walking on Interstate 225 Saturday when a vehicle drove through.
Police said a protester fired a weapon, striking at least one person who was taken to a hospital in stable condition.
Authorities said the vehicle was towed and they are investigating.
Protesters also broke windows to the courthouse and a fire was started in an office, police said.
An unlawful assembly was declared and police ordered protesters to leave the area, authorities said.
Tensions have been heightened at recent protests against racial injustice since federal officials were sent to quell demonstrations in Portland, Oregon.
Police declared a riot in Seattle on Saturday.
Protests sparked by the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man in Minnesota who died after a white officer held him to the ground with a knee to his neck, have also highlighted other cases of fatal police violence.
In Colorado, protesters have been drawing attention to the death of Elijah McClain, who was stopped by police while walking down an Aurora street in August 2019 after a 911 caller reported him as suspicious.
Police placed him in a chokehold, and paramedics administered 500 milligrams of ketamine, a sedative, to calm him down.
He went into cardiac arrest, was later declared brain dead and taken off life support.
Labour anti-Semitism whistleblowers demand Corbyn be expelled or face lawsuit
Labour could have to pay damages of between £3million and £8million, according to reports.
Now leader Keir Starmer is under pressure to expel Mr Corbyn.
Last night ex-party staff said they would drop the legal action if Mr Corbyn was ejected from the party.
The Labour Party has so far declined to comment on the demand.
However, Labour MP Jon Trickett said: "It is a ridiculous demand."
Supporters of Mr Corbyn said Mr Starmer needs to focus on tackling the Tories handling on coronavirus instead of delving back into Labour's internal divisions.
An ex-Labour Party source told the Daily Mail they would take legal action even if Mr Starmer did expel Mr Corbyn.
"I mean he's really, he's made the Labour party competitive again.
"There is still a long way to go on policy but he's made a really impressive start and he's got to a situation where for a lot of people who had really given up on the Labour party, voters as it were, I think they are now looking at it again much more sympathetically and they regard him as a serious figure."
Mr Blair did have concerns Labour is still seen as the party that raises taxes.
He said: "My experience with tax when you're in the Labour Party is be really careful because the public out there aren't sitting there worried as to whether you are going to raise taxes or not, they are probably worried that you are going to raise taxes so you've just got to be mindful of that concern."
Covid - 19 will permanently change the world's economy (opinion)
Virus screening is likely to become part of our life, just like security measures became ubiquitous after 9 / 11.
It is important to invest in the infrastructure necessary to detect future viral outbreaks.
This investment protects economies in case immunity to Covid - 19 turns out to be temporary.
Many economies adopted versions of Germany's Kurzarbeit (short work) subsidy during the pandemic.
This policy keeps workers employed at reduced hours and pay, with the government compensating some of the shortfall in wages.
By keeping matches between firms and workers intact, the economy is better prepared for a quick recovery.
It is important to improve the implementation of these policies and make them a permanent part of our economic recovery tool kit.
Remote work is likely to become more common.
We had some evidence that working from home is at least as productive as working at the office.
However, many companies were reluctant to embrace remote work.
Now that many have tried it with good results, remote work might be here to stay.
The pandemic crisis has accelerated the pace of digital transformation, with further expansion in e-commerce and increases in the pace of adoption of telemedicine, videoconferencing, online teaching and fintech.
Companies with international supply chains are dealing with shortages and bottlenecks.
We are likely to see many of these companies reshore some of their production.
Unfortunately, this trend will not create many jobs because most of the production is likely to be automated.
Governments will be bigger after playing the role of insurer and investor of last resort during the crisis.
Public debt will balloon, creating financial challenges around the world.
The most important lesson from the Covid - 19 pandemic is the importance of working together on problems that affect the entire human race.
We are much stronger united than divided.
Billboard giants push for discounts from airports, councils
oOh! Media raised capital earlier this year to provided more financial certainty as the pandemic started to spook advertisers.
Sources said that the companies were discussing ways to offset the large declines through a rent reduction for the sites they operate or through the removal or reduction of a minimum revenue guarantee, which is typically introduced when a deal is first signed.
One source indicated that the large billboard companies may have guaranteed as much as 85 per cent of their revenue projections in rent.
Some contracts have clauses that allow them to reduce the minimum guarantee if the amount of people in an area reduces by a certain percentage, but it is unclear whether this condition is in any of the current contracts between the billboard companies and their landlords.
At the same time, the companies are offering large discounts to advertisers to fill available slots on billboards and give them the most value for money possible.
Billboards in Sydney CBD and outer suburbs that typically host six ads are struggling to fill all of the available slots.
But some sites - such as oOh! media's 40 x 10 metre billboard at Sydney Airport - have been upgraded.
oOh! Media declined to comment, but at a Macquarie Australia conference in May, it flagged more than $20 million in fixed rent expense savings.
JC Decaux declined to comment.
Airports and public transport are lucrative advertising contracts for billboard companies.
According to the 2019 Outdoor Media Association Report, revenue from transport - including airports - was $169.4 million while revenue from street furniture and and the outside of buses and trams was $266.5 million.
JC Decaux business has contracts with Sydney Airport, Yarra Trams, Perth Airport and Sydney Buses.
oOh! Media has billboards in areas such as Qantas lounges, outside Sydney airport, Adelaide Airport, Darwin Airport and inside train stations in Sydney and Melbourne.
Tenders for Melbourne Airport and Sydney Trains have been taking place during the pandemic and an official decision has not been made.
Melbourne is the second largest airport contract in Australia and pre-coronavirus was worth tens of millions each year.
At full year results in February, oOh! Media said it generated $65.9 million from its' fly 'category, which is predominantly made up of revenue from Sydney Airport.
Revenue from 'commute', which is made up of the rail contracts and street furniture previously owned by Adshel before it was bought by oOh!, was $234.8 million.
JC Decaux Australia made $37.7 million in revenue from transport in 2018, according to its 2018 financial results filed to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission.
But both figures are likely to be significantly smaller this year.
Standard Media Index figures, which report the spend of four of the five major ad agency groups, said that the outdoor advertising market had plummeted 68 per cent in June.
By comparison, interim June results show that digital spending is down 37 per cent, while metropolitan radio had fallen 48 per cent.
Metropolitan television fell 34 per cent in June, newspaper spending dropped by 49 per cent and spending in magazines plummeted 66 per cent.
Coronavirus: Travellers from Spain told to quarantine
Travellers arriving in the UK from Spain must now quarantine for 14 days, under new coronavirus travel rules.
They were announced on Saturday following a spike in coronavirus cases in Spain, with more than 900 new cases of the virus reported on Friday.
Spanish officials have also warned a second wave could be imminent as major cities have seen cases surge.
Airlines including British Airways have criticised the new measures as "yet another blow" to British holidaymakers.
People currently on holiday in Spain have been advised by the Department of Transport to follow the local rules, return home as normal, and check the Foreign Office's travel advice website for further information.
The Foreign Office is advising against all but essential travel to mainland Spain, however the quarantine measures apply to those returning from mainland Spain, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, such as Majorca and Ibiza.
Foreign Office advice has ramifications for travel insurance.
Among those affected by the new rules is Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who began his holiday in Spain on Saturday.
He is expected to continue his trip as planned and isolate in line with guidance on his return.
Quarantine measures for UK travellers were first introduced in early June.
But after pressure from the aviation and travel industries, the government and devolved administrations published lists of countries exempt from the rules.
British Airways said it was "disappointed" about the latest changes to the government's travel advice and rules, although the airline said its flights were continuing to operate.
It said the move was "throwing thousands of Britons' travel plans into chaos."
The Airport Operators Association said the new measures would "further damage what is already a fragile restart of the aviation sector which continues to face the biggest challenge in its history."
The UK's biggest tour operator, Tui, cancelled its flights due to depart to mainland Spain and the Canary Islands on Sunday.
Customers currently on holiday will be able to return on their intended flight home.
However, budget airline EasyJet said it was "disappointed" and would operate a full schedule in the coming days.
"Customers who no longer wish to travel can transfer their flights without a change fee or receive a voucher for the value of the booking," the company said in a statement.
A spokesman for the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said the government's quarantine rule change was "disappointing."
"We suggest the government considers lifting the quarantine rules for flights to and from certain regions with lower infection rates, or to places such as the Balearic Islands or the Canaries - which are geographically distinct from mainland Spain - to avoid further damage to the UK inbound and outbound tourism industries," he said.
Spain has so far seen more than 28,000 coronavirus deaths.
On Thursday, it saw the biggest daily increase in infections since its lockdown ended.
Catalonia has become the latest region to crack down on nightlife.
The wealthy north-east region, which is home to Barcelona, ordered all nightclubs to close for two weeks and put a midnight curfew on bars in the greater Barcelona area.
The BBC's Guy Hedgecoe in Madrid says contagion among young people is a particular worry, as they have been gathering in large numbers in cities at night.
France has warned its citizens not to travel to Catalonia while Norway has said it will start quarantining people arriving from Spain.
The government is urging employers to be "understanding of those returning from Spain who now will need to self-isolate."
But Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds called for the government to explain in detail how it would support those affected, adding that the news would be "deeply concerning for families who are in caught in Spain or are planning travel."
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that the decision was made after reviewing the latest data earlier on Saturday.
"This reinforces the point that these matters are subject to change at short notice and so my advice is to be cautious about non-essential foreign travel," she said.
John Blackmore, from Hampshire, was due to fly out to his family in Spain with his wife and two young children.
But the new rules mean he has had to cancel, for fears his wife's employer would not be able to accommodate her taking an extra two weeks off to quarantine on their return.
He said he thought it was unlikely they would get a refund for the flight, as it has not been cancelled.
"I'm devastated," he told the BBC.
"I have family in Spain who haven't seen their only grandkids since Christmas."
Lois Stothard, from South Yorkshire, told the BBC she had booked a holiday to Seville as a surprise for her boyfriend's 30th birthday - due to fly out on Sunday morning - but now feels that she cannot travel.
"I'm a keyworker - I'm a teacher - and my boyfriend has work commitments so we cannot quarantine for 14 days when we return," she said.
"We can't get any money back and to change the company want double what I've already paid in fees. I'm very disappointed and upset as we're packed and ready to go."
Leicester happy to hit target of European football says Golden Boot winner Jamie Vardy
Jamie Vardy acknowledged his disappointment at missing out on Champions League football, but said Leicester City achieved their early-season objective of qualifying for Europe.
The Foxes were second in December and third when football restarted after lockdown, but they took just four points from their last five games to finish fifth in the Premier League.
A final-day win over Manchester United would have secured a top-four finish, but Brendan Rodgers "side suffered a 2 - 0 loss, which Vardy says was the most upsetting aspect.
"It was disappointing, more the way we've ended up losing the game," he said on Sky Sports at full-time.
"But we've said in the dressing room, we targeted behind closed doors to qualify for Europe and we've done that.
"We had the chance to qualify for the Champions League and that was even better, but we'll reflect on it and come back stronger next year.
"It's hard to take, but our main target was Europe and we've managed to do that."
While his team fell short, Vardy himself ended the season as the Premier League's top scorer at 33 years of age, scoring 23 times.
He paid tribute to his team-mates in receiving the award and said there are still plenty of miles left in him at the top level, despite his advancing age.
"I'm delighted, it's all about the team. I wouldn't have been in the position I was for the goals without them and I've put quite a few away.
"I'll have a rest for a bit now and come back for next season ready to go.
Fortunately I don't feel my age, my legs are still fine and touch wood I don't pick up many injuries, so it's about keeping on top of that and come back as strong as I can next year. "
'What happened there?!' UFC fighter Correia gets pummelled after turning back on rival mistakenly thinking round is over (VIDEO) - RT Sport News
Brazilian bantamweight Bethe Correia is a UFC veteran but made an amateur error by turning her back on opponent Pannie Kianzad and mistakenly thinking the round was over in their bout on Fight Island, and got tagged as a result.
Coming to the end of the first stanza of their showdown on the undercard in Abu Dhabi, the 37 - year-old Correia appeared to mistake the 10 - second warning for the actual end of the round, reaching out a glove before turning her back on Kianzad and making her way back to her corner.
The Swedish fighter capitalized without hesitation, tagging her opponent with a right hand before following up with a series of blows to back Correia against the cage.
Momentarily appearing in danger, the Brazilian then regained control to stifle the threat and back Kianzad up before the actual end of the round was called.
"What happened there? Oh my word," the commentary team on ESPN + were heard exclaiming.
It was just one part of a frustrating night for former bantamweight title challenger Correia, who went down to a unanimous decision defeat which is her third loss in her past four octagon outings and leaves her overall record at 11 - 5, with one draw.
For the Iranian-born Kianzad, 28, it was a second win on the spin following her victory over Jessica-Rose Clark at UFC Fight Night in Moscow back in November.
Kianzad is now 13 - 5 overall and 2 - 1 in the UFC, as the woman known as' Banzai 'aims to shift up the 135lbs rankings.
Elsewhere on the night, Australia's Robert Whittaker edged out England's Darren Till in the middleweight main event, while Russian-born fighter Khamzat Chimaev made history by winning a second bout in 10 days on Fight Island, the shortest-ever period between victories in the modern-era UFC.
Rahul Gandhi Goes To People On Rajasthan Issue
Congress's Rahul Gandhi tweeted a video today attempting to mobilise the people against the BJP over the events in Rajasthan.
Using hashtag # SpeakUpForDemocracy, his Hindia post urged the people to "Unite and raise our voice for democracy."
The Congress is planning a countrywide protest on Monday over the situation in Rajasthan, where the Ashok Gehlot government is struggling to survive.
While the party said a protest will be held outside the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of President Ram Nath Kovind.
In the video, the Congress has accused the BJP of "Ripping up the constitution and demolishing democracy" while the whole country is fighting the coronavirus.
It has done the same in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress said.
"We demand to immediately convene an assembly session which is within our constitutional rights," the party said in the video.
Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra has turned down one proposal to start an assembly session.
A second one was submitted today which he said he is examining.
Mr Gehlot's government has been in deep crisis after his deputy Sachin Pilot turned rebel with a chunk of MLAs supporting him.
The party has been unable to disqualify the rebels to bring down the majority mark in the assembly.
Mr Pilot - - who was stripped of his posts in the party and the government - - has been given temporary relief from disqualification by the Rajasthan High Court, which held that the Speaker cannot take any action until the larger constitutional question about his powers is decided.
That question will be taken up tomorrow by the Supreme Court, which will also decide whether a court can interfere with the Speaker's decisions.
The Congress stands only one past the majority mark in the 200 - member assembly.
Team Pilot claims the support of 30 MLAs, but so far, the evidence points to only 19.
The BJP has 72 and including allies and Independents, it stands at 97.
If the court decides in favour of Mr Pilot, the Congress can lose the second of the three governments it formed in the heartland states following the 2018 assembly elections.
In March, it lost the Kamal Nath-led government in Madhya Pradesh after Jyotiraditya Scindia joined the BJP with 22 of his MLAs.
Seattle Protests: Fires and Pepper Spray as Thousands March Through City
SEATTLE - After weeks of escalating confrontations between protesters and federal authorities in Portland, Ore., a crowd of about 2,000 people mobilized in Seattle on Saturday, marching through the streets and clashing with the police.
Three police officers were injured, including one who was hospitalized with a leg injury caused by an explosive, and 16 protesters were arrested as of early evening, the police said.
Carrying signs such as "Feds Go Home" and shouting chants of "No justice, no peace," the protesters stopped at the site of a future youth detention center and lit buildings there on fire. Some smashed windows of nearby businesses.
The police confronted the crowd in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, deploying flash grenades and pepper spray before they began taking people into custody.
Bipasha Mukherjee, 52, of Kirkland, Wash., said she has been protesting on the streets since May and said it was worrisome to her to see such aggressive tactics by the police.
"This is not the country I immigrated to," said Ms. Mukherjee, who arrived from India more than 30 years ago. "It feels like we are rapidly becoming a fascist state and a police state."
Michaud Savage of Seattle said the protests were aimed at both local authorities and the deployment of federal officers who have waged a crackdown against a long-running protest in Portland. Mr. Savage said the law enforcement tactics in Portland, which have included the use of tear gas and crowd-control munitions, were dangerous and inappropriate.
"It's a very hard slide in an extremely violent direction," Mr. Savage said as he washed his eyes of pepper spray and nursed a wound on his arm from a flash grenade.
The death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis in May ignited mass protests that drew millions to the streets in dozens of cities, but those demonstrations have waned in most cities.
Seattle and Portland, however, have seen extended demonstrations. Seattle protesters at one point laid claim to several blocks of the Capitol Hill neighborhood and declared an autonomous zone. After a series of shootings there led the police to clear the area, protests had subsided.
Portland, meanwhile, has continued protesting, with some of the heaviest protests around federal buildings in the city. After President Trump issued an executive order to protect statues and federal property, the Department of Homeland Security deployed tactical teams to the city, beginning a series of clashes that have resulted in injured protesters, inspector general investigations and calls from local leaders for federal agents to leave.
Protest crowds in that city have swelled into the thousands, and demonstrations there were continuing. This week, federal officials deployed a tactical team to Seattle, and protesters cited that development as one reason for Saturday's demonstrations.
While the Portland protests have centered in downtown, the demonstrations on Saturday roamed areas east of the downtown core, where the city's federal courthouse is.
Kansas City mayor welcomes federal help in solving murders, but worries about Trump's motives
Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas questioned on Sunday President Trump's motives for sending federal agents into U.S. cities - saying that while he would welcome the help in solving a slew of murders in the Midwestern city, he thinks the move could be more about buoying Trump's reelection chances.
"I was pretty frustrated this week [that] the president mentioned the George Floyd protests, mentioned the Black Lives Matter movement," Lucas, a Democrat, said on "Fox News Sunday" of the recent protests over racial inequality and police brutality.
"That is not the case in Kansas City. We've had year-over - year increases [but] what we need help on is actually clearing some of the unsolved murders."
Lucas added: "Let's try to have a pinpointed and targeted focus on solving murders... I think if you listen to recent statements... we are happy to work with federal agents in a limited scope."
Despite his willingness to have federal agents work with local law enforcement, Lucas said that Trump's rhetoric - specifically in light of the controversy surrounding the tactics employed in Portland, Ore., by the federal agents - has caused many of his constituents to voice concern about the presence of agents on the city streets.
"What we don't need is more fuel on the fire from federal agents to make, I think, an exciting political issue," he said.
Trump on Wednesday announced that he was deploying 100 federal agents to Chicago to help combat rising rates of some crimes - a move that marks an expansion of the White House's intervention into local law enforcement as Trump continues to position himself as the "law and order" president.
The "surge" of agents announced on Wednesday to Chicago and other American cities is part of Operation Legend - named after 4 - year-old LeGend Taliferro, who was fatally shot while sleeping in a Kansas City apartment late last month.
While sending federal agents to aid local law enforcement is not unprecedented - Attorney General Bill Barr announced a similar surge effort in December for seven cities that had seen spiking violence - the type of federal agent being sent, and some of their tactics, have raised concerns among state and local lawmakers.
A number of lawmakers from New York to Portland have spoken out against the Trump administration sending the agents to their cities, especially following reports that unidentified federal agents detained protesters in Portland and took them away in unmarked vehicles.
Portland has been hit with near-daily demonstrations against police brutality and systemic racism since the death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody on May 25.
Local authorities also have complained that the surges have only exacerbated tensions, and criminal justice experts say the efforts defy explanation because of the unprecedented moment America is living through - with a pandemic, historic unemployment and a mass reckoning over racism and how people of color are treated by police.
£10m fund set up to support Scottish events
Organisers of cultural, community and sporting events are to be offered financial support while they remain affected by lockdown restrictions.
The Scottish government's £10m funding package also aims to help event suppliers.
The government said it was looking at how events could restart safely in the future.
Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop said the coronavirus pandemic had had a "devastating impact" on the sector.
Scotland's festival scene and sporting events such as the Highland games have been among those affected by restrictions brought in to prevent the spread of Covid - 19.
Ms Hyslop said: "Whilst we've had the positive step that drive-in events can resume, most of the sector will be unable to operate for some time to come.
"We've worked closely and constructively with the sector on the challenges they face and they have brought forward some creative ideas on how they can begin to operate safely.
"In addition to providing immediate support, some of this funding will look to bolster innovation and aid the longer-term recovery of the events industry."
The Event Industry Advisory Group said the sector had been one of the first to go into lockdown and would be among the last to fully emerge from it.
Chairman Peter Duthie, who is also chief executive of the SEC in Glasgow, said events contributed about £6bn each year to Scotland's economy.
He said: "Additional funding from government for this important sector is very welcome and much needed, both by the event organisers and the wider supply chain businesses who are being hit exceptionally hard by the ongoing effect of an extended period of lockdown."
Shivraj Singh Chouhan On Testing Covid Positive
Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who on Saturday confirmed he had tested positive for COVID - 19, tweeted Sunday morning to say that he is "fine" and to offer his praise for front-line workers in the war on coronavirus.
The Chief Minister also repeated his warnings from yesterday, when he urged people to follow guidelines, such as social distancing and the use of face masks.
"I am fine, my friends. The dedication of coronavirus warriors, who selflessly risk their lives, is praiseworthy. I salute all coronavirus warriors of the state," Mr Chouhan tweeted from Bhopal's Chirayu Hospital, where he was admitted yesterday.
"Keep two metres distance, wash your hands frequently and wear face masks - these are the biggest weapons we have to avoid the coronavirus. I appeal to all people - use these weapons for yourself and your loved ones," he said.
"All of you be careful, stay safe and healthy. This is what I pray to God," Mr Chouhan added.
On Saturday Mr Chouhan had tweeted that he had tested positive for the virus despite his best efforts to avoid infection and warned that "just a little carelessness invites the coronavirus."
Tweeting this morning Mr Chouhan said that despite the threat of infection there was "no need to fear" and urged those showing symptoms to get themselves tested.
"If you are infected, there is no need to fear. Do not hide symptoms but tell doctors immediately, so treatment can be started. Timely treatment will make you healthy," he said.
Madhya Pradesh has nearly 27,000 COVID - 19 cases, of which more than 7,600 are active and 799 are deaths linked to the virus.
India has recorded a surge in COVID - 19 cases in the past weeks, with over 45,000 new cases detected every day since July 23.
The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases is rapidly approaching 14 lakh; of these more than 4.67 lakh are active cases and over 32,000 are deaths linked to the virus.
The spike in cases, coinciding with the staggered relaxation of lockdown guidelines in non-containment zones of the country, has propelled India to third on the list of most affected nations.
Only the United States (41.78 lakh cases) and Brazil (23.94 lakh cases) are worse off.
Kanye West says he can beat Joe Biden "off of write ins" - RT USA News
Fresh from airing his family's dirty laundry on Twitter, rap enigma Kanye West has once again breathed life into his will-he - won't-he presidential bid, claiming that he could beat Joe Biden on write-in votes alone.
Days after announcing a new album and revealing that he's been trying to divorce wife Kim Kardashian for two years, Kanye West again turned his attention to his 2020 presidential campaign on Saturday, in an all-caps announcement declaring "I CAN BEAT BIDEN OFF OF WRITE INS."
If West is still serious about running for the presidency, write-in votes may be his only path to victory, or indeed any kind of showing.
The rapper announced his candidacy on July 4, past the deadline to file as a candidate in at least six states.
Nevertheless, West pressed ahead and filed the proper papers with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), and managed to get his name on ballots in Oklahoma.
Since then he's held one campaign rally, during which he addressed a crowd clad in a bulletproof vest, delivering his speech without a microphone or podium.
West came out against abortion, weeping as he delivered a pro-Christian message he said would make the media "tell you that I'm crazy."
That much was true, and West's rally was described across news sites and gossip mags as a publicity stunt, evidence of mental illness, or both.
However, a recent poll put West at two percent nationwide, neck and neck with the Libertarian Party's Jo Jorgensen and a point ahead of the Green Party's Howie Hawkins.
While it is extremely unlikely that he could surpass Joe Biden's reputed 48 percent, he could in theory siphon enough votes from Biden to see President Donald Trump clinch a second term - something pundits on both sides suspect may be his plan.
Rock from Mars heads home after 600,000 years on Earth
A small piece of rock will be hurled into space this week on one of the strangest interplanetary voyages ever attempted.
A tiny piece of Martian basalt the size of a 10p coin will be launched on board a US robot probe on Thursday and propelled towards the red planet on a seven-month journey to its home world.
This extraordinary odyssey, the interplanetary equivalent of sending coals to Newcastle, will form a key part of Nasa's forthcoming Mars 2020 expedition.
Space engineers say the rock - which has been donated by the Natural History Museum in London - will be used to calibrate detectors on board the robot rover Perseverance after it lands and begins its search for signs of past life on the planet.
Some of the Martian meteorites we have are very fragile, but we chose this one specifically because it's as tough as old boots
"When you turn on instruments and begin to tune them up before using them for research, you calibrate them on materials that are going to be like the unknown substances you are about to study.
So what better for studying rocks on Mars than a lump that originated there? "said Professor Caroline Smith, the Natural History Museum's curator of meteorites.
Scientists were confident that the rock they were returning to Mars originated on the planet, added Smith, who is also a member of the Mars 2020 science team.
"Tiny bubbles of gas trapped inside that meteorite have exactly the same composition as the atmosphere of Mars, so we know our rock came from there."
It is thought that the Martian meteorite was created when an asteroid or comet plunged into the planet about 600,000 to 700,000 years ago, spraying debris into space.
One of those pieces of rubble swept across the solar system and eventually crashed on to Earth.
That meteorite - now known as SAU 008 - was discovered in Oman in 1999 and has been in the care of the Natural History Museum since then.
Among the instruments fitted to the Perseverance rover is a high-precision laser called Sherloc, which will be used to decipher the chemical composition of rocks and determine if they might contain organic materials that indicate life once existed - or still exists - on Mars.
The inclusion of a piece of SAU 008 is intended to ensure this is done with maximum accuracy.
"The piece of rock we are sending was specifically chosen because it is the right material in terms of chemistry, but also it is a very tough rock," added Smith.
"Some of the Martian meteorites we have are very fragile. This meteorite is as tough as old boots."
Once Perseverance has selected the most promising rocks it can find, it will dump them in caches on the Martian surface.
These will then be retrieved by subsequent robot missions and blasted into space towards Earth for analysis.
Man found with gunshot wounds in Mambourin near Werribee
A man has been rushed to hospital after being shot in Melbourne's west overnight.
Police were called to Mambourin, near Werribee, about 8pm where they found a man aged in his 20s with suspected gunshot wounds to the lower body in Yard St.
The man was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
Police said the investigation was ongoing.
Sunday with Oliver Spencer: "I won't get dressed up, Sundays are for loungewear '
How does Sunday start?
With me stumbling down the stairs and falling over the dog on my way to make my wife a cup of tea.
If I'm lucky, we'll have escaped London to our coastal house on the Isle of Wight.
The two of us will sit together and look across the water in silence.
It sounds serene...
It is, until 8am when two or three of our boys bang on the door demanding breakfast.
It's bacon and eggs for them, spinach and mushrooms for us; then if the weather's good, we kick the boys out.
We'll swim, paddleboard or take a walk around the beautiful Quarr Abbey, which looks like something straight out of Game of Thrones.
And during lockdown?
For the first two weeks I was in total denial, I couldn't believe my business was shut down.
I distracted myself by obsessing about the life or death of my newly planted garden.
Otherwise, I've been experimenting in the kitchen: intensely flavoured eel and shiitake broth and a double cream brioche have been my standouts.
How do you unwind?
I won't get dressed up, Sundays are for loungewear, half-cropped tracksuit bottoms and a white T-shirt.
After a lunch of roast chicken, I'll snooze with the papers on a deckchair in the garden.
I try not to drink: it helps clear my head before Monday comes calling.
A Sunday that sticks out?
After a long Saturday night at my sister-in - law's 40th birthday party in New York, around midnight my heavily pregnant wife decided we'd better get going.
She was determined to enjoy herself, telling people it was her third after all.
We left the party and she went straight into labour.
And Sunday night?
By 7pm we've packed the car and have boarded the ferry to Portsmouth.
A drive up the A3 and we're back in London for the week: kids in bed, I walk the dog and have a bowl of cereal.
I'm good with leaving the Isle of Wight to head back to the city, I know if I don't, I can't have a home there at all.
Kenyan police officers arrested after fatal shooting in Garissa
Two police officers in Kenya have been arrested in connection with a shooting in which two people were killed.
The shooting happened at Soko Ng 'ombe market in eastern Garissa county on Saturday, during a protest against the arrest of a man suspected of murder.
The two victims have been named as Aden Abdi Madobe and Muhiyadin Adow Shibin.
Kenya's police watchdog has launched an investigation into the shooting.
It will include "forensic analysis" of the officers' guns.
Garissa MP Aden Duale called the deaths "heinous" and condemned "police brutality" in a statement posted to Facebook.
Campaigners have raised concerns about policing during the pandemic.
According to Amnesty International, Kenyan officers have killed 21 people since March for failing to comply with coronavirus prevention measures such as curfews and mask-wearing.
Earlier this month police in the capital Nairobi fired tear gas and arrested several protesters taking part in the annual Saba Saba march - a protest event which started 30 years ago against the autocratic regime of then-President Daniel arap Moi.
Correspondents say this year's event was given extra impetus by anger over police crackdowns during the Covid - 19 lockdown.
Tight Security Presence outside US Consulate in Chengdu, China
There was a tight security presence outside the U.S. consulate in the city of Chengdu, China Sunday, as the American staff prepared to leave the premises.
Three moving trucks were seen entering the building compound, while uniformed and plainclothes police lined both sides of the street, which were lined with metal barriers.
The editor of China's Global Times tabloid tweeted that the U.S. consulate in Chengdu was given 72 hours to close, or until 10 a.m. (0200GMT) Monday, July 27.
China charged that some personnel at the Chengdu consulate were "conducting activities not in line with their identities."
Without giving any details, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, Wang Wenbin said such activity had interfered in China's affairs and harmed its security interests.
China's order to close the consulate in Chengdu was issued Friday in retaliation for a U.S. order to close the Chinese consulate in Houston, Texas.
Washington ordered China to close the Houston office "to protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information."
As Chinese consulate closure in Houston took effect on Friday, a group of men who appeared to be U.S. officials were seen breaking-in to the facility through a back door.
Wang said on Saturday that violated international and bilateral agreements and China would respond, without specifying of how.
The tit-for - tat closures further escalated the tensions between the two countries over issues from trade and industrial espionage to human rights.
Safari park baboons seen armed with knives, screwdrivers and CHAINSAW as' pranksters give them weapons to wreck cars'
The primates at Knowsley safari park, Merseyside, are long known to pounce on anyone pausing in the enclosure and ripping off a windscreen wiper or mirror.
Baboons have been armed with knives, screwdrivers and even chainsaws at Knowsley safari park, Merseyside.
Workers fear pranksters are arming the pesky primates, who are known to pounce on anyone who pauses and rip off windscreen wipers and mirrors.
Workers now fear they are being armed with the lethal weapons "for a laugh" by visitors to bolster their attacks and the apes have even been seen rummaging around toolboxes themselves.
One park worker told The Sunday Times: "We're not sure if they are being given weapons by some of the guests who want to see them attack cars, or if they're fishing them out of pick-up trucks and vans."
"They will literally go into people's toolboxes and carry them around. One of the baboons was seen lugging around a chainsaw."
Another worker said: "The baboons have been found with knives and screwdrivers. I do wonder if it's some of the guests handing them out."
And the baboon attacks are so inevitable that mechanics across the northwest of England have come to know the enclosure well.
One mechanic in Sale, Greater Manchester said people know what to expect at the park and that he has had two customers fall victim to the baboons this year.
They added that one minute kids want monkeys on the car and the next it has no registration plate - but the issue provides "good money" for the garage.
Knowsley reopened on June 15 with Covid - 19 security measures after insisting it was as safe as a McDonald's drive-through as visitors do not leave their car on the five mile safari drive.
The 550 - acre park, home to lions, tigers, rhinos, wildebeest and camels, dismissed reports of armed apes as an urban myth.
A spokesperson said: "We believe many of these stories have grown in exaggeration as they've been retold, with embellishment to make the objects that are sometimes found in the enclosure seem more exciting and unbelievable."
In 2012 car manufacturer Hyundai let 40 monkeys from the park loose on its New Generation i30 model for 10 hours to prove it had the strength for families with small children.
United, Chelsea into CL; Bournemouth, Watford down from EPL
Manchester United and Chelsea qualified for the Champions League at the expense of Leicester on a frantic final day of the Premier League season on Sunday, while Bournemouth and Watford were relegated to end five-year stays in the top flight.
United won 2 - 0 at Leicester through goals by Bruno Fernandes and Jesse Lingard to give Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team a third-place finish.
Chelsea beat Wolverhampton 2 - 0 after a goal and an assist by Mason Mount and finished in the fourth and final Champions League qualifying place above Leicester, which has been in the top four for most of the season.
Leicester, instead, will play in the Europa League along with Tottenham, which drew 1 - 1 at Crystal Palace to secure sixth place - above Wolverhampton on goal difference.
The battle to avoid the two remaining relegation places went to the wire as Aston Villa scored in the 84th minute, conceded a minute later, then held on for 1 - 1 draw at West Ham to survive.
Captain Jack Grealish scored Villa's goal in what could be his last game for his boyhood club.
Bournemouth did what it had to do and beat Everton, 3 - 1, but ended up one point behind Villa.
Watford was also relegated as the next-to - last team after losing 3 - 2 at Arsenal.
Manchester City passed 100 goals for the campaign with a 5 - 0 win over last-place and already-demoted Norwich, a game that marked the last in the Premier League for David Silva after 10 years with City.
Kevin De Bruyne got a record-tying 20th assist of the season and also scored twice.
Liverpool ended its title-winning season with a 3 - 1 win at Newcastle and finished on a club-record 99 points.
Also, Southampton beat Sheffield United 3 - 1, with Danny Ings scoring his 22nd goal of the season.
That left him one behind Leicester's Jamie Vardy, who won the Golden Boot as the league's highest scorer.
Gwyneth Paltrow wants kids to have good 'worth ethic'
Gwyneth Paltrow has said she wants to raise her children to have a good worth ethic as she tries' not to just hand them things'.
Paltrow has two children, Apple (16) and Moses (14), with ex-husband Chris Martin and she wants them to have good values and not get by on their parents fame.
"That's why I think it's so important... To raise a kid that has a work ethic and whose values are aligned with yours or with their own sense of who they are, etc," she told Rob Lowe on his podcast.
"The truth of the matter is the doors can be opened for you, but if you think about all the people who try and it doesn't happen."
She added, "As a parent you think, all I can do for these kids is teach them right from wrong and teach them what work is. I've really have tried not to just hand them things."
Paltrow has also taken steps to allow her children to live as privately as possible, and ensures they keep their social media accounts private.
"I won't let them be public on any social media or anything like that, I try to keep them out of the public eye as much as possible," she said.
"You know, now it's different, 'cause kids are like,' Can I have a YouTube channel? 'and I'm like,' No, you can't. Absolutely not."
Tunisia interior minister named new PM, to form government in a month
Tunisia's Interior Minister Hichem Mechichi has been appointed to form the next government, the president's office said, amid political tensions among major parties in the North African country.
The 46 - year-old lawyer succeeds Elyes Fakhfakh, who resigned as prime minister earlier this month.
But Mechichi was not one of the names proposed by the governing political parties to President Kais Saied.
In a statement following Saturday's announcement, Mechichi said he would "work to form a government that meets the expectations of all Tunisians."
Tunisia has been praised as a rare success story for democratic transition after the Arab Spring regional uprisings sparked by its 2011 revolution.
But its leaders have struggled to meet the expectations of the Tunisian people and the already fragile economy has been battered by the closure of the country's borders because of the COVID - 19 pandemic.
The disease has killed nearly 50 people and infected more than 1,400 in Tunisia.
As well as being the interior minister in the outgoing government, Mechichi has been a counsellor to President Saied, handling legal matters.
He has previously been chief of staff at the Ministry of Transport and also served in the Ministry of Social Affairs.
He now has a month to form a government, which will then face a parliamentary vote of confidence and will need an absolute majority to succeed.
Failing that, parliament will be dissolved and new elections will be held within three months.
In the last elections held in October, the Ennahdha party came on top but fell far short of a majority and eventually agreed to join a coalition government.
Fakhfakh's resignation on July 15, after less than five months in office, threatened fresh political deadlock in the nation as it struggles with the economic fallout of the pandemic.
The resignation deepened the political dispute with Ennahdha over allegations against Fakhfakh of conflicts of interest.
Relations between the 47 - year-old outgoing leader and Ennahdha have been strained since the October legislative elections.
Fakhfakh stepped down the same day the party filed a no-confidence motion against him.
Ennahdha had initially nominated an independent for prime minister, but he failed to win the support of parliament, leading the president to name former Finance Minister Fakhfakh for the post.
Faced with the prospect of fresh elections, Ennahdha eventually agreed to join the coalition government.
Ted Cruz says Pelosi's objectives are "shoveling cash at the problem and shutting America down"
Washington - Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats of pushing a coronavirus relief package that focuses on "shoveling cash at the problem and shutting America down" as negotiations on the next measure continue.
In an interview with "Face the Nation" on Sunday, Cruz said the country is confronting two crises simultaneously: a global pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than 600,000 people worldwide and an "absolute economic catastrophe" in the U.S.
But Cruz said Pelosi, who appeared on "Face the Nation" ahead of the senator, "is" focused on neither of those. "
"Her objectives are shoveling cash at the problem and shutting America down," the Texas Republican said.
"And in particular, you look at the $3 trillion bill she's trying to push, it's just shoveling money to her friends and not actually solving the problem. Our objective should be Americans want to get back to work. They want to be able to provide for their family."
Senate Republicans and the White House spent last week negotiating the terms of the fourth phase of the coronavirus response, which they expect to cost $1 trillion.
Over the weekend, White House chief of staff Mark Meadow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin headed back to Capitol Hill for more talks with Senate staff, and Mnuchin told Fox News in an interview Sunday the details are set to be unveiled by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday.
The most pressing issue for lawmakers - and a point of contention between Republicans and Democrats - is the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits, which began to go away this weekend.
While Democrats want the "phase four" coronavirus package to keep the $600 boost to the benefits, Republicans are calling for it to be pared back and argue some Americans make more from unemployment than they did in wages.
Cruz said more than half of Americans receiving the enhanced unemployment benefits are paid more now than when they were working and said he's talked to small business owners in Texas who are having trouble rehiring employees.
"Of course, they won't come back because the federal government is paying them, in some instances, twice as much money to stay home," he said.
Cruz said Congress should be focusing on passing a recovery bill that would make it easier for Americans to return to work by easing taxes and regulations on small businesses:
"instead of just shoveling trillions out the door, a recovery bill would suspend the payroll tax, which would give it a pay raise to everyone in America who's working. That actually gets people back to work," he said.
President Trump demanded last week the next aid package include a payroll tax cut, but Mnuchin said it will not be part of the legislation, as the proposal was ill-received among Republicans.
Mr. Trump acknowledged the payroll tax cut would be absent from the next bill but sought to pin the blame on Democrats.
Cruz, who last week objected to the cost of the next package, said Sunday he is not on board with the measure from his fellow Senate Republicans.
But he also criticized the $3 trillion bill passed by the Democrat-controlled House in May and accused his political opponents of deliberately crafting a measure that damages the president ahead of the November election.
"The only objective Democrats have is to defeat Donald Trump, and they've cynically decided the best way to defeat Donald Trump is shut down every business in America, shut down every school in America," he said.
"You know, Nancy Pelosi talks about working men and women. What she's proposing is keeping working men and women from working."
Kanye West issues public apology to wife Kim Kardashian after marriage revelations
Kanye West has apologised to wife Kim Kardashian for going public with a "private matter."
The rapper revealed during an event in South Carolina that the couple had considered aborting their first child.
Following a tumultuous week in which he made a series of claims against his wife and her family, West has now tweeted an apology.
West also reportedly paid a visit to hospital hours after being visited by Justin Bieber at his ranch in Wyoming.
He said: "I would like to apologise to my wife Kim for going public with something that was a private matter. I did not cover her like she has covered me."
"To Kim I want to say I know I hurt you. Please forgive me. Thank you for always being there for me."
West's erratic tweets including claims his wife had tried to get him locked up by doctors and he made a series of accusations against his mother-in - law, Kris Jenner.
He also said he had tried to divorce Kardashian West, who he married in 2014.
Amid fears for her husband's state of mind, Kardashian West, the mother of West's four children, issued a lengthy statement saying she and her family were "powerless" to intervene and reminded fans he has bipolar disorder.
She said: "He is a brilliant but complicated person who on top of the pressures of being an artist and a black man, who experienced the painful loss of his mother, and has to deal with the pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bi-polar disorder."
She added that she has not discussed his condition before because she is "very protective of our children and Kanye's right to privacy when it comes to his health."
She added: "But today, I feel like I should comment on it because of the stigma and misconceptions about mental health."

Man Arrested For Allegedly Killing Alcoholic Brother In Greater Noida: Police
A 37 - year-old man was arrested on Sunday for allegedly killing his brother, whose body was found dumped in an isolated area a week ago, in Uttar Pradesh's Greater Noida, the police said.
The accused told the police he was peeved by his brother's alcoholism and misbehaviour with women members of their joint family, which led him to the crime, according to officials.
The body of Bhisham Singh, a resident of Bisrakh village in Greater Noida, was found near bushes in an isolated area around a week ago.
The body bore stab marks and an FIR was lodged at the Bisrakh police station and investigation taken up, a police spokesperson said.
"During the probe, evidence led the police to the man, who died, his brother Deepak and he was questioned.
When quizzed, Deepak confessed to stabbing his brother to death.
He told the police that Bhisham would frequently consume alcohol, create ruckus at home and misbehave with women family members because of which he decided to kill his brother, "the spokesperson said.
The accused has been arrested and charged for murder and other related charges, the police said.
Tony Blair vows never to stop meddling in British politics despite severe Brexit backlash
Tony Blair has pledged not to stop intervening in UK politics, following severe backlash to his involvement in the Labour Party and anti-Brexit campaigning.
Mr Blair, who has been out of office for more than ten years, told Sophy Ridge on Sky News that he will "never" stop speaking out in British politics.
However, the controversial political figure acknowledged "a lot of people watching this might think I should stop talking about things."
Sophy Ridge told Mr Blair: "I always get the sense you can't wrench yourself away from politics.
"You are always publishing reports on coronavirus or coming up with arguments on Brexit.
"I just wonder if people think, why after ten years of being PM, are you still trying to be involved in politics?
"Isn't it time to take some time out, go around the golf course."
The former prime minister rejected this and vowed to stay around in UK politics as long as he can.
He said: "It's not something I want to do. A lot of people watching might think that's exactly what he should do and stop talking about things, but I care about the country."
"We are at a huge moment of change in the world and the institute I built works around the world.
"I know I've done something that previous prime ministers have not done but in the future I predict many more will try to do."
Earlier in the interview, Mr Blair said that the UK and EU could still land a deal on Brexit before the end of the year.
He said: "They could land a deal. But even the deal we land is going to be bad."
"It's essentially going to be good for Europe because it will allow easier trade in goods but very inhibiting for us on the issue of services."
The former Labour leader also told Sky News the UK is going to be living with COVID - 19, not eliminating it, for the foreseeable future.
During Tribute To Kargil Heroes, PM Narendra Modi Says Pakistan Tried To "Backstab" India
Pakistan tried to "backstab" India despite her attempts to keep friendly relations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said today in his tribute to the armed forces on the 21st anniversary of Kargil war.
In his monthly radio address Mann ki Baat, PM Modi said "Pakistan undertook this misadventure with sinister plans to capture India's land and to divert its ongoing internal conflicts."
"Pakistan had the audacity of trying to occupy Indian soil and deviate attention from its own internal unrest," he said.
"At the time, India was trying for improve relations with Pakistan.
But as it is said, evil's nature is to fight everyone without reason.
People of this nature can only think of doing evil even to those who try to do them good.
That's why Pakistan backstabbed India despite India's attempts at cordial relations, "he said.
"You can imagine, the enemy was perched high on the mountains while our forces were fighting them from below. But the high morale and true of our forces won against mountains," he added.
"Thanks to the courage of our armed forces, India showed great strength in Kargil," PM Modi said, recalling his own visit to the area.
Kargil Diwas is celebrated every year, marking the day the Indian Army recaptured all the Indian posts in Ladakh's Kargil that had been occupied by Pakistan's army 21 years ago.
On July 26, 1999, the Army had announced the successful culmination of "Operation Vijay."
The nearly three-month battle in the icy heights of Ladakh had claimed the lives of more than 500 Indian soldiers.
Earlier today, defence minister Rajnath Singh, his junior minister Shripad Naik, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, Army Chief General M M Naravane, Air Chief Marshal R K S Bhadauria and Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh also paid tributes at the Amar Jawan Jyoti at the National War Memorial.
In the decades since Kargil, India-Pakistan relations have been strained following a series of terror strikes.
India has insisted that talks and terror cannot go hand-in - hand and Pakistan needs to dismantle all the terror camps operating from its soil.
Online lenders warn SME loan scheme may miss the mark
The small business sector, often under-served by the big banks, has increasingly turned to online lenders to meet its funding needs.
However, Mr Callaghan said online lenders were disadvantaged compared to the big banks because they did not have access to the same lower priced funding and warned as a result the SME guarantee scheme was not gaining traction.
"I think it has probably missed the mark where all the people who call us, call in the expectation they can get very cheap funding rather than the government backing 50 per cent of the loan," he said.
"So they call and they get very disappointed because the expectation has been put out there that there is discount pricing and we look at our cost of funding which hasn't changed at all."
Mr Callaghan added if fintechs were able to access cheaper funding and pass that on to small businesses the scheme would be a "no brainer."
"It's been a bit of a Catch 22 the major banks have got access to the lower cost funding but they are more risk averse so they don't actually go out to lend in the same way, they can't get access to the data and they can't get comfortable unless you have property," he said "Until we can access that cheaper funding I think there is a fiction out in the market on how popular the scheme is going to be."
Melbourne-based Moula is also participating in the scheme and chief executive Aris Allegos said the benefit of the 50 per cent guarantee, implicit in the government scheme, should be passed on to small businesses but different lenders were handling this in different ways.
"I can understand there might be others who are not passing through that cost structure," he said.
"That might be a function of how their funding is structured and it might be a function also of which categories they are lending into and how they assess risk within those categories."
Mr Allegos would not provide details of the number of loans Moula had issued under the scheme but said the revamped scheme was "a core recognition of what needed to change" to offer more flexibility to lenders and borrowers.
However, he said his major concern was the "two speed economy" that was operating and the impact this would have on small businesses.
"The biggest issue Moula has to face and lenders with respect to small businesses is that proverbial cliff and how to manage into that cliff," he said.
"Generally speaking with respect to demand we have not returned to pre-COVID levels although appetite is growing."
ASX-listed online lender Prospa also would not detail the amount of loans it had issued under the scheme as it said the information was commercially sensitive but chief executive Greg Moshal said the goverment's extension of the scheme was welcome.
"We support any enhancements to the scheme that will enable small businesses to access a wide range of funding products that meet their requirements, including flexible cash flow products over shorter terms," he said.
Virginia Beach takes down Confederate monument
VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. - - The city of Virginia Beach removed a 115 - year-old Confederate monument from public grounds on Saturday, less than two days after the City Council voted unanimously to do so.
Workers took down the 27 - foot (8.2 - meter) tall monument on Saturday morning, media outlets reported.
It was installed in 1905 and stood outside the old Princess Anne County courthouse, in the same place that slave auctions were once held.
The council voted unanimously Thursday night to begin the removal process.
The council had listened to dozens of speakers and decided the monument is viewed by many as divisive and a painful reminder of the past.
The statue recently had been completely covered, with a locked gate around it following recent protests and vandalism at other Confederate monuments.
The monument will be stored for now.
The city now must wait for any offers from historical groups or other entities that might want to take the monument.
Police try new, less-lethal tools as protests continue
As violent clashes continue between law enforcement and protesters in Portland and around the country, debate is swirling around how police can cut back on lethal force.
Some companies are stepping up to offer new high-tech tools like remote handcuffs for police to use instead of the more dangerous options like pepper spray, rubber bullets and flash grenades.
Human rights group Amnesty International analyzed 500 videos from protests from May 26 through June 5 and found 125 incidents of excessive force across 40 states and the District of Columbia.
"We saw a misuse of tear gas, pepper spray, pepper balls, 40 millimeter impact rounds, basically every combination of less-lethal weapon being used in inappropriate ways," said Amnesty International weapons investigator Brian Castner.
Still, some insist that having options is important for avoiding the need for a firearm.
"All of these devices should be at hand for the cops to use other than deadly physical force being used by a firearm because it's the only profession in America where the citizens give you the right to take your life," said Corey Pegues, former New York Police Department Deputy Inspector.
One of the newest tools is called the Bola Wrap, a handheld device that shoots out an 8 - foot Kevlar cord that wraps around a suspect.
There are Long Range Acoustic Devices, also known as sound canons, directed energy weapons that use lasers to heat a person's skin, new projectiles made from things like foam and chalk, stink bombs, and of course the Taser.
Shares of Axon, the company that makes the Taser, spiked more than 18%, reaching all-time highs when protests turned violent days after the police killing of George Floyd.
The market for less-lethal weapons is expected to reach $11.85 billion by 2023.
Watch the video to get a look at the new high-tech tools police are using for less-lethal force, how they're regulated, and what's at stake for the future of policing and the communities they serve.
UN says thousands of anti-Pakistan militants in Afghanistan
ISLAMABAD - - A U.N. report says more than 6,000 Pakistani insurgents are hiding in Afghanistan, most belonging to the outlawed Pakistani Taliban group responsible for attacking Pakistani military and civilian targets.
The report released this week said the group, known as the Tehreek-e - Taliban (TTP), has linked up with the Afghan-based affiliate of the Islamic State group.
Some of TTP's members have even joined the IS affiliate, which has its headquarters in eastern Afghanistan.
The Afghan government did not respond Sunday to requests by The Associated Press for comment.
The report said IS in Afghanistan, known as IS in Khorasan province, has been hit hard by Afghan security forces as well as U.S. and NATO forces, and even on occasion by the Afghan Taliban.
The report was prepared by the U.N. analytical and sanctions monitoring team, which tracks terrorist groups around the world.
The report estimated the membership of IS in Afghanistan at 2,200, and while its leadership has been depleted, IS still counts among its leaders a Syrian national Abu Said Mohammad al-Khorasani.
The report also said the monitoring team had received information that two senior Islamic State commanders, Abu Qutaibah and Abu Hajar al-Iraqi, had recently arrived in Afghanistan from the Middle East.
"Although in territorial retreat, (the Islamic State) remains capable of carrying out high-profile attacks in various parts of the country, including Kabul.
It also aims to attract Taliban fighters who oppose the agreement with the United States, "the report said, referring to a U.S. peace deal signed with the Taliban in February.
That deal was struck to allow the U.S. to end its 19 - year involvement in Afghanistan, and calls on the Taliban to guarantee its territory will not be used by terrorist groups.
The deal is also expected to guarantee the Taliban's all-out participation in the fight against IS.
The second and perhaps most critical part of the agreement calls for talks between the Taliban and Kabul's political leadership.
Late Saturday, the U.S. State Department issued a statement saying its peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad was again shuttling through the region seeking to jump start those negotiations, which have been repeatedly postponed as both sides squabble over a prisoner release program.
The U.S. - backed deal calls for the Afghan government to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners and the Taliban to free 1,000 government and military personnel as a so-called good will gesture ahead of talks.
Until now the government is refusing to release nearly 600 Taliban prisoners it calls high-profile criminals and has offered to free alternatives.
The Taliban have refused.
"The parties are closer than ever to the start of intra-Afghan negotiations, the key next step to ending Afghanistan's 40 - year long war," said the U.S. State Department statement.
"Although significant progress has been made on prisoner exchanges, the issue requires additional effort to fully resolve."
The Taliban's political spokesman earlier this week said it was ready to hold talks with Kabul's political leaders after the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha at the end of the month, providing the prisoner release is completed.
A big worry for Pakistan is the presence in Afghanistan of militants, particularly linked to the TTP or Jamaat-ul - Ahrar or Lashkar-e - Islam, as well as those with the Baluchistan Liberation Army, which has taken responsibility for high-profile attacks this month in the southern Sindh province as well as in southwestern Baluchistan Province.
Several Pakistan military personnel have been killed this month in southwestern Baluchistan province in battle with insurgents.
The TTP took responsibility for one of the most horrific attacks in Pakistan in 2014, when a Pakistani army school was attacked and 140 were killed.
Most were students, and some were as young as 5.
"The total number of Pakistani foreign terrorist fighters in Afghanistan, posing a threat to both countries, is estimated at between 6,000 and 6,500, most of them with TTP," the report said.
Top British bank HSBC denies "setting up trap" for China's Huawei in US investigations - RT Business News
London-headquartered multinational bank HSBC took to social media to say it was not, as Chinese media claimed, "fabricating evidence" against Huawei, which led to the arrest of the company's chief financial officer in Canada.
In a now-unavailable post on WeChat, the lender said that its actions did not trigger US investigations into the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment, as the scrutiny of Huawei for allegedly violating US sanctions on Iran began well before the bank's involvement in late 2016.
"HSBC does not have any hostility towards Huawei and did not" frame "Huawei," the bank said on Saturday, adding that it would never distort any facts about its clients.
"In response to US DOJ's [US Justice Department] requests for information, HSBC Group simply presented the objective facts.
HSBC did not "fabricate" evidence or "hide" facts. "
The post has been blocked on the platform with a note that it "violates regulations" and is not available now.
The statement comes shortly after multiple Chinese media outlets, including state-linked newspapers, accused HSBC of "conspiring" with Washington to set a trap for Huawei.
The company has been at the epicenter of a diplomatic scandal for more than a year and a half since Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in December 2018 in Canada on a warrant from the US.
Meng faces fraud charges for allegedly using a shell company to violate sanctions against Iran and allegedly lying to banks about the link between Huawei and Iranian company Skycom.
According new evidence cited by the Global Times, HSBC was well aware of the Chinese company's relationship with Skycom.
The bank reportedly opted to "collude" with the US government to escape more severe punishment in 2012, when the bank had to admit to money laundering and sanctions violations, including restrictions on Iran.
It was ordered at the time to pay around $1.9 billion in penalties and to prevent any similar misconduct.
"The evidence indicated that HSBC understood this relationship but intentionally sold out its customer's confidential business documents to the US side so that the US government could overlook the British bank's own misconduct and not punish it under the 2012 Deferred Prosecution Agreement," the newspaper said in one of its articles on the matter.
In a veiled warning, the Beijing-controlled newspaper added that the lender, if proven to be guilty of this "collusion," could face "harsh punishment" in China, one of the major markets for HSBC.
It is not the first time the renowned bank has come under fire in recent weeks.
Last month, HSBC was lambasted for supporting the new national security law for Hong Kong, the city where its business started and which accounts for over half of its profits.
The bank faced criticism from both sides - from the West, with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling the endorsement a "corporate kowtow," and the East, with the Chinese side reportedly saying that its support was "belated."
Angola: Pedalé Hospital Assigned to Health Ministry
Luanda - The President of the Republic, João Lourenço, determined this Friday the transfer of the supervision of the Pedro Maria Tonha Pedalé Hospital, under construction in Luanda, to the sphere of the Ministry of Health.
In a note, the Press Office of the President of the Republic informs that the measure aims to materialize the Government principle of construction and expansion of the network of public hospitals to ensure better medical care and medication to the population.
"In this specific case, the idea is to make available to Angolans a reference hospital, differentiated and equipped with modern technology and high precision in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of high complexity," the document reads.
It stresses that the decision of the Angolan Head of State also takes into account the demographic growth of the country, which has motivated a "huge demand" for quality health services in the most diverse specialties.
This demand, the note continues, justifies with the inclusion in the hospital specialized for the treatment of complex diseases, teaching and research, interventions related to ophthalmology and maternal-infant medicine, areas whose strategy and management deserve to be under the responsibility of the Ministry of Health.
Algeria: Mahmoud Guemama's Death - Algeria Loses a Patriot, Committed Militant, Says President Tebboune.
Algiers - President of the Republic, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, sent a message of condolences to members of the People's National Assembly (APN), Mujahed Mahmoud Guemama, who died Friday, in which he said that Algeria "has lost a patriot and a militant committed to the causes of his people and his nation."
Algeria loses today, by the death of Mujahed Mahmoud Guemama, a patriot and a militant committed to the causes of his people and his nation, a man who has never wavered and whose determination remained intact from the moment he took up arms, alongside his valiant Mujahedeen brothers, until his last breath on this sad day when we can only resign ourselves to God's will, "President Tebboune wrote in his message of condolence.
"The late Mahmoud Guemama, peace be upon him, belonged to a unique generation of faithful patriotic militants who sacrificed themselves for their homeland," added President of the Republic.
"The deceased devoted his life to the liberation of Algeria from the torments of abject colonialism, by joining the ranks of the Revolution in the prime of life in 1960 in the Tahart training camp of the historic wilaya VI."
"The late President is known to all for his proven militancy and his commitment to anchoring the image of a prosperous and united Algeria," said President Tebboune.
"In the far south, the late Mahmoud Guemama enjoys great renown as a mediator, intervening to reconcile brothers in the same country whenever the fire of discord is kindled," added the President in his message.
"All these qualities and values earned the late Mahmoud Guemama the respect and trust of the people of Tamanrasset who chose him to represent them in the People's National Assembly (APN) for several terms, during which he was the ambassador and defender of the concerns of the region and the aspirations of its people, and even the representative and spokesman of all Algerians," wrote the President of the Republic.
"All expressions of condolence will not be enough to pay tribute to the mujahed Mahmoud Guemama, peace be upon him.
He is leaving us today at a time when Algeria needs him, "said the President.
"I pray to Almighty God to surround the deceased with His Holy Mercy, to welcome him in His vast paradise alongside the shuhadaa and virtuous.
I also pray to God to lend his family and loved ones patience and comfort... there is no strength or power except in God, "the President of the Republic concluded.
Coronavirus Travel Update: Which Countries Have Travel Restriction for Bulgarians Upon Entry
The number of countries imposing travel restrictions is growing. As of this week, the Czech Republic wants coronavirus tests for Bulgarian seasonal workers. Denmark allows Bulgarians on its territory only if they have an address registration there, an employment contract or a document certifying a business trip.
As of today, people who have visited Bulgaria and Romania in the last 14 days are subject to mandatory quarantine in Italy. In Finland, entry is only for a "valid reason."
Mandatory home quarantine in Austria, despite a negative PCR test. This is already required for those entering Germany. For the next 14 days, access to southern Romania was denied without good reason. And Greece has tightened measures even more along its land borders.
From Tuesday, those traveling by plane from Bulgaria to Greece will have to present to the Greek border authorities a negative result from a PCR test for coronavirus, performed up to 72 hours before their entry into our southern neighbor, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced.
They added that only passengers who have a certificate for such a test will be allowed in the country. It must be issued in English and contain the three names and numbers of the passenger's passport or identity card. The authorities in our southern neighbor will not accept certificates that do not meet these requirements
"Travelers should be tested in the laboratory by RT-PCR by taking secretions from the mouth or nose. Tests for coronavirus will be recognized if they are performed in national reference laboratories, national health laboratories or private laboratories that are accredited by the relevant national accreditation bodies (not necessarily specifically for COVID - 19).
The measure does not apply to Greek citizens, citizens residing in Greece and travelers for significant professional reasons.
The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs also announced that on Tuesday, July 28, and Wednesday, July 29, passengers who did not have time to be tested before their trip will be tested by the competent Greek authorities upon arrival in Greece.
The requirement for citizens traveling by plane to Greece to fill in at least 24 hours in advance an electronic Passenger Location Form (PLF) generating a QR code, which they present to the Greek authorities upon entering the country, remains in force. More information is published on travel.gov.gr
At the moment there is no change in the requirements for crossing the land borders between Bulgaria and Greece. "Travelers to Greece across the land border, regardless of their citizenship, must also fill in an electronic passenger localization form (PLF) generating a QR code at least 24 hours before arrival," the Foreign Ministry explained.
The closure of the Ilinden, Kapitan Petko Voyvoda and Makaza checkpoints has increased traffic across the border near Petrich. There are no problems with the transition. There are no queues of trucks. All those waiting go to sea in Greece. Travelers wait about an hour and a half to cross the Tower.
Three of the points on the Bulgarian-Greek border are working. Only "Ilinden - Exohi" and this part of Ivaylovgrad are closed.
Dominic Cummings is held hostage by the SAS... on base tour
PM's chief adviser underwent the experience last week during a tour of the base
The idea of Dominic Cummings being held hostage with rifles pointed at his head might be one for some harassed civil servants to secretly savour.
But the Prime Minister's uncompromising chief adviser underwent just this experience last week during a tour of the SAS headquarters, Stirling Lines.
The Mail on Sunday can reveal that part of his visit on Wednesday involved a trip to the "Killing House" where elite soldiers hone their skills on tackling terrorists.
The guided tour of the Hereford base also included an inspection of the regiment's military hardware and a briefing on recent operations, including efforts to eliminate Islamic State terrorists in Iraq.
High-profile visitors to Stirling Lines are offered an unusual welcome - a turn in the "Killing House," a two-storey building where the SAS practise close-quarter fighting.
Previous guests include Princess Diana, whose hair caught fire thanks to a spark from a grenade thrown during an exercise in 1983.
It is understood that Mr Cummings arrived at the base - named in honour of the regiment's founder, Colonel David Stirling - by helicopter.
He also visited the neighbouring Pontrilas Army Training Area where other top-secret units are based.
The visit was part of his tour of Britain's highly classified UK security installations that has raised eyebrows among politicians and military chiefs.
When news of his plans emerged earlier this month, Tobias Ellwood, a Tory backbencher and chair of the Commons Select Defence Committe, said MPs should be given the same opportunity to question him about defence and security matters as they are afforded for Ministers and civil servants.
Special advisers, who are appointed by politicians, are rarely required to give evidence to select committees.
It is understood that senior SAS officers used Wednesday's event to stress the importance of maintaining the number of personnel in the Royal Marines and the Parachute Regiment.
It has been reported that these units, which provide the majority of Special Forces troops, could shrink or be merged to save money.
"More than half the soldiers in the 250 - man SAS were previously Paras while the even smaller Special Boat Service (SBS) couldn't continue without the support of the Royal Marines," said a defence source.
"So Cummings was told that these units must be preserved in their entirety."
Mr Cummings, who has complained that military procurement "has continued to squander billions of pounds," recently attended meetings at the headquarters of MI5 and MI6 and is also planning to visit the SBS's headquarters in Poole, Dorset, along with the Government's top secret laboratories at Porton Down in Wiltshire.
Last night, the Ministry of Defence did not respond to a request for comment.

Firefighters gain ground on Lassen County blazes
Firefighters are gaining ground against two wildfires that have burned more than 30,000 acres in Lassen County, northeast of Sacramento.
The Gold fire, which started south of Adin, is 40% contained as it continues to threaten homes and ranches as well as agriculture, livestock and timber operations, Cal Fire officials said in an update Saturday morning.
After burning for four days, the fire has chewed through 21,000 acres, destroyed seven homes and sent two firefighters to the hospital.
Overnight, firefighters took advantage of milder conditions to build and reinforce control lines.
But gusty winds and low humidity are expected through Saturday.
West of Susanville, a smaller fire known as the Hog fire has destroyed two structures and consumed about 10,000 acres.
The fire settled down overnight as firefighters worked to mop up and strengthen control lines, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
By Saturday morning, it was 45% contained and had been burning for six days.
In the daytime heat, with temperatures above 90 degrees in the Susanville area, smoldering patches were at risk of flaring up.
While some residents are being allowed to return to their homes, some areas in both fire zones remain under mandatory evacuation orders.
The two firefighters injured in the Gold fire have been released from the hospital.
Scotland-England Union Chain Bridge is 200 years old
A bridge linking Scotland and England has turned 200 years old ahead of a £10m renovation.
The Union Chain Bridge crosses the River Tweed from Fishwick in the Scottish Borders to Horncliffe in Northumberland.
When it opened in 1820, it was the longest wrought iron suspension bridge in the world with a span of 449ft (137m).
It was also the first vehicular bridge of its type in the UK.
The bridge was designed by English Royal Navy officer Capt Samuel Brown.
He patented and produced wrought iron chains after being affected by the loss of Royal Naval ships which had broken free from ropes.
Friends of the Union Chain Bridge and the Institution of Civil Engineers (Ice) Scotland have been marking the crossing's bicentennial.
Robert Hunter, of the friends group, said: "This is truly one of the most historic bridges in the world and a fascinating piece of engineering.
"We had planned a number of celebrations to mark the occasion, but unfortunately they have had to be postponed.
"However, the fact that work is shortly going to begin on the £10m renovation is the best birthday present possible and will ensure generations to come will be able to enjoy the bridge in all its splendour."
Ice Scotland director Hannah Smith described the bridge as an "often-overlooked" part of Scotland's engineering heritage.
She said: "We know it is renowned the world over and it is fantastic that work will shortly commence on its renovation."
North Korea declares state of emergency as Covid - 19 case reported
North Korean leader Kim Jong-un convened an emergency politburo meeting after a person suspected of having Covid - 19 returned from South Korea after illegally crossing the border this month, state media said on Sunday.
If confirmed, it would be the first case officially acknowledged by North Korean authorities, who have so far said the country has no confirmed cases of coronavirus.
Kim declared a state of emergency and imposed a lockdown on the border city of Kaesong, calling it a "critical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country," state news agency KCNA reported.
According to KCNA, a person who defected to South Korea three years ago returned across the fortified border that divides the two Koreas with symptoms that suggested Covid - 19.
"An emergency event happened in Kaesong city where a runaway who went to the south three years ago, a person who is suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus returned on 19 July after illegally crossing the demarcation line," KCNA said.
KCNA did not specifically mention whether the individual had been tested, but said an "uncertain result was made from several medical check-ups of the secretion of that person's upper respiratory organ and blood," prompting officials to quarantine the person and investigate anyone he may have been in contact with.
North Korea has received thousands of coronavirus testing kits from Russia and other countries, and imposed strict border closures.
Thousands of people in the secretive nation were quarantined, but restrictions had recently eased.
In recent weeks, North Korea has also stepped up a campaign criticising defectors to South Korea as "human scum" and calling for South Korea to crack down on groups that send propaganda messages and food aid into the North.
Kim ordered an investigation into the military units along the border where the person was suspected of crossing to "administer a severe punishment and take necessary measures."
Threats to Australian democracy are closer to home than China
But a series of recently passed or pending measures in the Commonwealth Parliament give rise to concerns about our own, home-grown authoritarianism.
They include a roll out of facial recognition technology, forcing technology companies to decrypt information held on their customers "computer systems, forcing technology companies to provide access to their customers" cloud-based information without notification to the owner of the information and extending ASIO's compulsory questioning powers.
These measures raise serious questions about the border between citizens and government, but the ASIO Bill is particularly worrying.
Unlike any of the other Five Eyes countries - United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand - in the wake of September 11, ASIO was given power to compulsorily question people for up to seven days in relation to terrorism offences.
While it might be accepted that the extreme violence associated with terrorism offences justifies extraordinary powers - extreme violence at least offers a bright line border around these extraordinary powers.
That certainly cannot be said about the "sweeping and vague" definitions used in this bill to trigger the compulsory questioning power: dealing with information which prejudices Australia's "political, military or economic relations with another country"; or activities in collaboration with a foreign power which are clandestine or deceptive and are "detrimental to Australia's interests."
It is hard to imagine more "sweeping and vague" national security "legislation" than this.
ASIO would be allowed to compulsorily question anyone about these things - not just suspected offenders.
This includes journalists, business people, university academics and staff, lawyers, citizens, residents and visitors.
ASIO would simply have to show the questioning would "substantially contribute to the collection of intelligence" about foreign interference, which seems to be the main target of the bill.
The person could then be questioned for up to 40 hours (not including breaks).
If the person refused to attend, they would be arrested.
Refusal to answer or giving false or misleading answers would carry a maximum five year sentence.
Rules that are fundamental in our legal systems - indeed protected by the constitution in the United States - are overturned by this bill.
People - including people already facing charges - will be compelled to provide evidence that may then be used to prosecute them.
They could have a lawyer present, but the lawyer would be confined to clarifying questions that were ambiguous or unclear.
The new bill transfers the decision to issue a questioning warrant from a judge to the Attorney-General.
As pointed out by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, this "departs from the trend for increased requirements for external authorisation in other Five Eyes jurisdictions."
It also breaches the separation of powers principle that courts scrutinise the actions of executive government.
The new bill also proposes to expand the questioning power to children who are at least 14 years old, but only to those engaged or likely to engage in activities prejudicial to the protection of Australia and people from politically motivated violence.
Even if our intelligence agencies were the best in the world, conferring a power to compulsorily question anyone about information which "prejudices Australia's economic relations with another country," or activities which are "detrimental to Australia's interests" is beyond the pale.
We stand alone.
No other Five Eyes country goes so far, not even for terrorism offences.
Genuinely liberal democracies guard against authoritarian measures.
The conduct of our security agencies in relation to the bugging of the East Timor parliament, the trials of Witness K and Bernard Collaery, the secret trial and imprisonment of a former intelligence officer, the recent search warrants executed on two journalists, and the prospect of charges against one of them in relation to stories on suspected murders by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan show why we should not be lowering our guard.

"The Persians" Review: Aeschylus's Ancient Portrait of Defeat
There is not much action, barely even a plot, in "The Persians." People just mill about, talking (admittedly rather intensely) about events (admittedly of the tragic kind) that happened far away.
Yet this National Theater of Greece production unleashes gale-force sound and fury. At its peak, the show hits like a blow to the solar plexus, taking your breath away - the impact is only slightly dulled by watching online.
First produced in 472 B.C., Aeschylus's "The Persians" is considered the oldest surviving Greek play. This Dimitris Lignadis staging was broadcast live on Saturday from the ancient amphitheater of Epidaurus; in the spirit of the theater, no recording exists online. The venue was originally conceived as part of the city's asclepeion (a healing center) because the Greeks considered the balance between body and soul essential to good health. Let's all wistfully ponder that philosophy.
The show deals with the aftermath of Salamis, a naval battle in which the outnumbered Greeks routed the mighty Persian army 2,500 years ago. At a time when our horizons are closing in, it is downright vertigo-inducing to virtually join a live audience in watching (subtitled) live actors all the way in Greece as they perform a millenniums-old play.
Aeschylus himself had fought at Salamis, but his play has a twist: This veteran of the winning side set his story among the defeated, casting a fairly sympathetic eye on his recent enemies "distress.
A chorus of Persian men, wearing long, tan-colored skirts and white button-down shirts, opens the proceedings. They are in their capital city anxiously waiting for news of their king, Xerxes, who is off duking it out with Athens.
Enter Xerxes's widowed mother, Queen Atossa (Lydia Koniordou), in a rather large black gown that appears to wear her, rather than the reverse; she is a human in an exoskeleton of fabric, both vulnerable and formidable. Koniordou, who is among Greece's greatest stage actresses, knows the role inside out - she directed and starred in an earlier National Theater of Greece production of "The Persians" that played New York City Center in 2006 - and she anchors the proceedings without seemingly doing much at all. For the most part, she stands in the middle of the circular stage, effortlessly projecting smoldering fury and agonizing sorrow as the scope of the disaster that befell the home troops is revealed.
The apprehension everybody was feeling is confirmed, in harrowing details, by a messenger (Argyris Pandazaras) returning from the front. In an absolutely incredible scene, he recounts the battle, whipping himself into a frenzy as the chorus members dance around him and Giorgos Poulios's drone-like score swells to what must have been a deafening level.
Later they are joined by Atossa's dead husband (Nikos Karathanos), summoned from the underworld, and Xerxes (Argyris Xafis), who has somehow escaped alive from the wreckage. Pieces of string on his tunic mark blood (Eva Nathena's exquisite costumes always contribute to the storytelling). The characters lament the lost lives and devastation together, in an act of communal mourning.
Quite a bit of the classical theater we see in the United States attempts to make it more accessible in one way or another. Often this is done with relatively naturalistic line readings, in an effort to make the text less foreign, easier to digest. But Lignadis and his troupe fully embrace declamation, which may sound a little forced to modern ears but highlights the text's rhythmic power. While technically they do not sing, for example, the four lead actors essentially deliver arias, achieving an incantatory power that feels otherworldly.
We never forget, though, that the play is rooted in emotions that are all too human.
Egypt begins registering data of voters abroad for senate elections
The National Election Authority (NEA) on Saturday began registering the data of voters aboard to begin casting their votes in the senate elections to be held on August 9 and 10, according to the NEA's official website.
Voters must register their data and the diplomatic mission affiliated to their residence abroad on the NEA's website from July 25 until July 31.
The NEA also published a video explaining the steps voters can take to cast their vote remotely via email, as part of precautions against the coronavirus pandemic.
The legal period of senate candidate electoral propaganda runs from July 26 until August 8, the NEA said.
Minister of Emigration and Egyptian Expatriates Affairs Nabila Makram called on Egyptian voters abroad to participate in the election as their constitutional right.
Egypt's House of Representatives on June 17 approved a law establishing a senate, which will function as an upper house of parliament.
The law passed with a two-thirds majority, with the objection of four MPs.
The Senate will consist of 300 members, 100 of whom are elected by a closed list system, 100 elected by an individual system, and 100 members appointed by the President of the Republic.
The term of membership in the Senate will be five years, starting from the date of its first meeting. The new assembly is to be elected during the sixty days preceding the end of its term.

Israel coronavirus cases top 60,000 as infections jump
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The number of people to test positive for coronavirus in Israel topped 60,000 on Saturday as the government struggles to contain a resurgence in infection rates.
The latest daily tally showed 1,770 new infections, bringing the total number of cases to 60,496, the country's health ministry reported.
With a population of nine million, Israel has reported a total of 455 fatalities from the pandemic.
Israel was one of the first countries to impose a nationwide lockdown and initially was successful in clamping down on the outbreak.
Daily cases that numbered in the hundreds dropped to low double digits.
Concerned about the economic toll, the government eased those restrictions - too quickly, some officials have since acknowledged - and infection rates resurged.
Renewed sporadic closures of various sectors of the economy have deepened public vexation, sparking daily demonstrations.
Be wary of gardening gimmicks that look too good
It might be an embarrassing thing for a plant scientist to admit, but I am a total sucker for a garden gimmick.
I like to think it's because I am open-minded or maybe just irrationally optimistic, particularly as many things in the plant world are often extremely counterintuitive.
But I am not ashamed to say I have fallen for dozens of them over a lifetime in horticulture.
While I firmly believe in the value of trying things out for yourself, if you don't fancy learning the hard way, here are some of the most common garden gimmicks I have come across.
First up, and probably the worst offender, grafted tomato-potato plants.
Hailed as a revolutionary breakthrough, grafting tomato plants on to potato roots is, in fact, an old-school botanical curiosity, dating back to at least the 1920s.
As they are both from the same family and have broadly similar internal "plumbing," you can indeed create such surgically enhanced marvels.
But here's the problem: creating resource-intensive structures like fruits and roots takes up a lot of metabolic energy, and if plants are attempting to do both their limited energies inevitably become split.
That means the yields of these grafted plants are terrible and nothing like what you see in the marketing pictures.
Then there is the fact that the crops mature at different rates, so to harvest the spuds you have to kill the plants before the tomatoes have ripened.
On the subject of marketing imagery, there's a lot of dodgy dealing here, too.
I've seen roses Photoshopped sky blue and fruit trees with a physiologically impossible amount of fruit on their branches in some major catalogues.
I've even seen photos "borrowed" from my Instagram account and used by shopping networks as images of their trial grounds.
Sadly the work of a small minority of cavalier companies mean you have to view advertising images, particularly online, with a very sceptical eye.
If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.
Speaking of which, the colour blue is relatively rare in the botanical world, so if you see a dazzling new heather, orchid or cactus, shining out in the most intense "disinfectant" shade of blue, it's almost certainly been sprayed or dyed.
Which would be fine, so long as vendors made this clear, but they rarely ever do.
Blue moth orchids will revert back to their original white, but sprayed cacti and heathers, coated in a light-suppressing layer of dye, are unlikely to survive for long.
Finally, I have to flag up bonsai kits or, even worse, bonsai seeds, that promise miniature trees will sprout from their packets.
Bonsai is not a species of plant.
It's a training technique used to give the illusion of ancient trees on distant mountaintops.
They are almost always started from mature shrubs that are hacked back and new growth wired in place.
I know I'll keep falling for gimmicks, it's part of the fun of experimentation.
But side-step these ones and you may find one that actually has a chance of living up to its promise.
Spain quarantine: Do you need to quarantine in Spain?
No - but if you return from Spain after midnight tonight, you will have to self isolate at home for 14 days.
British Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said: "The decision to exempt Spain earlier this week, was taken when the data showed there was an improvement in the spread of the virus.
But clearly the latest data has given us cause for concern to overturn that decision.
"We appreciate that this will be disappointing. However, we have always been clear we are closely monitoring the pandemic situation in all countries and that we may require to remove a country from the list of places exempt from quarantine requirements should the virus show a resurgence."
"It is still active and it is still deadly. Suppressing the virus, preventing it from being transmitted and protecting public health is our priority."
No rules around UK travellers arriving in Spain have been announced, however if you are travelling to Spain you should check for local regulations in your area.
Spain's deputy emergency health director Maria Jose Sierra said:
"We have important outbreaks. It could be a second wave. We'll have to see what happens in the next few weeks."
Pakistan's Imam-Ul - Haq Declared Fit To Bat After Warm-Up Injury

Over 30 Employees Test Coronavirus Positive At Single Bank Branch In Tamil Nadu
At least 38 employees of a national bank's main branch in Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, have tested positive for coronavirus, officials from the bank and the local civic body have said.
According to the officials, the customers who visited the bank have also been advised to voluntarily appear for coronavirus tests.
Earlier, a senior official of the branch who was suffering from other complications, had died of COVID - 19.
The positive cases came to light after a mass medical screening camp was held at the bank recently, the officials said.
Senior bank officials said the disinfection process had been completed and the bank might resume operations from tomorrow.
Corporation health officials are in touch with the customers who visited the bank.
Tamil Nadu, with the highest virus cases in the country after Maharashtra, has reported an overall 2,06,737 positive cases of the virus as of Saturday.
India's PM to attend temple groundbreaking at disputed site
NEW DELHI (AP) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend a groundbreaking ceremony next month for a Hindu temple on a disputed site in northern India where a 16th century mosque was torn down by Hindu hard-liners in 1992, according to the trust overseeing the temple construction.
The ceremony is set for Aug. 5, a date organizers said was astrologically auspicious for Hindus but that also marks a year since the Indian Parliament revoked the semi-autonomous status of its only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir.
The symbolism was impossible to miss for both supporters and opponents of Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, whose manifesto had for decades included pledges to strip restive Kashmir's autonomy and to build a temple to the Hindu god Ram where the Mughal-era mosque once stood, a site in the city of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh state that devotees believe to be Ram's birthplace.
Because the coronavirus is still rampaging across India, which has reported the world's third-highest caseload, the ceremony will be broadcast live on state television and the number of participants and spectators will be limited, according to Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or the World Hindu Organization, a Hindu nationalist group allied with the BJP.
The temple will serve as "an enduring and immortal beaming center of social harmony, national unity and integration and awakening of the feeling of Hindutva," or Hindu way of life, the organization's spokesperson Vinod Bansal said in a news release Saturday.
A century-long dispute over the site was resolved last year following the BJP's landslide election victory.
In November, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the temple trust, saying that Muslim petitions would be given five acres at an alternative site.
Hindus hard-liners have long contended that Mughal Muslim invaders built a mosque on top of a preexisting temple in the ancient city of Ayodya.
A December 1992 riot following the destruction of the mosque sparked communal violence in which about 2,000 people were killed, mostly Muslims.
Meanwhile, the trial in the demolition court case continues to be heard in a special court.
An architect from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, Modi's home state, has proposed a towering sandstone structure 161 feet (49 meters) high with five domes.
Yogi Adityanath, Uttar Pradesh's chief minister and a Hindu monk, requested that Ayodhya hold a special cleaning and purification ceremony and for all of the city's temples to light oil lamps ahead of Modi's visit, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.
Adityanath said the occasion marked the end of a "500 - year struggle," PTI reported.
Xinhua Commentary: Outstanding returning rural migrant workers can be a rural revitalization army - Xinhuanet
Talent is the key to rural revitalization.
Where is talent found?
Outstanding returning rural migrant workers are an indispensable force in the fight.
Published by Xinhua News Agency Author: Shang Haichun
Xinhua News Agency, reported July 26th Headline: Outstanding returning rural migrant workers can be a force for rural revitalization - Xinhuanet
Zhang Xiong, age 34, is a resident of Guoyuan Village in Meishan City, Sichuan Province who quit his job with a salary over 10,000 yuan in Beijing and returned to his hometown to start a business in 2010.
After a few years of effort, his family ’s vinery now earns an annual income of over a million yuan, he has gained a small amount of fame for being a wealth creator, and he has also been selected as a member of the village ’s “Two Committees ”.
In recent years, national policies to alleviate poverty, revitalize rural areas, and benefit farmers and agriculture have inspired an increasing number of people outstanding migrant workers like Zhang Xiong to return to their hometowns to start their own businesses, which has become a new source of growth for rural areas.
Sichuan is a western Chinese province with a large population and that produces high labor outflows, but thanks to the province ’s “Outstanding Rural Migrant Worker Return Incentives and Cultivation Project ”, in 2019 alone, the program has produced more than 8,000 village party branch secretaries from returned outstanding rural migrant workers, brought back and cultivated a labor force of 61,000 for villages, and produced over 20,000 new Party members, creating a powerful guarantee in the fight to eliminate poverty and implement rural revitalization strategies.
Hometowns are the key to moderate prosperity.
Since reform and opening up, huge numbers of young in China have left rural villages to seek work elsewhere, and some, through their own hard work, have managed to start their own companies.
But objectively speaking, to varying degrees, it has also led to the “hollowing out ” of Chinese villages, especially those where grassroots organizations are weak, and led to the“ aging and lowering ” phenomenon among village Party branch secretaries and cadres, in which these groups are both getting older and have lower educational attainment, leading to disinterest among young people in continuing the work of village Party organizations with weak leadership.
If rural talent and other assets only flow in one direction, to the cities, in the long term this leads to “loss of blood ” and“ anemia ” in rural areas, in turn making “revitalization ” an empty slogan.
Attracting back migrant workers who are capable, conscientious, and determined to serve their hometowns, incentivizing them to return there to start businesses and become wealth creators, and then cultivating them as Party members and rural cadres to enrich the ranks of grassroots cadres is a permanent solution to the problem of young people not continuing the work of rural Party corps and grassroots Party organizations.
Once outstanding rural migrant workers return, they also must be convinced to stay and do good work.
In recent years, Sichuan has focused more on Party-building among rural migrant workers, and on the basis of strict selection requirements, has established systems and mechanisms such as directed incentives for outstanding rural migrant workers to return, service guarantees, training and promotion, and selection and use which ensure they will gain from their effort, receive guarantees in their work, have things to look forward to in life, truly put down roots in the village, and feel a sense of accomplishment in their work and entrepreneurship.
This is the final year of the battle to decisively end poverty, and talent is the key factor to establish the connection between poverty alleviation and rural revitalization.
Party committees and governments at every level should prioritize rural migrant workers who return to their hometowns, and should use comprehensive measures to form them into a work corps and army that is willing to stay, capable of contributing, and unwilling to leave, so that they can serve as a powerful organizational guarantee and talent pool that supports rural poverty elimination and prosperity building efforts, as well as rural development and revitalization.
Thanks to the pandemic, this year ’s university graduates are a very special class: On the evening of July 11th, the “Bilibili Summer Graduation Songs ” offered up a special online show for new graduates with performances from musicians such as Lao Lang, Pu Shu, Li Yuchun, and Mao Buyi to give graduates a sendoff of music and good wishes.
The famous host of Up, Seal Wu, performed his song “Wild Grass ”, a rap song based on Lu Xun ’s poem of the same name, which is very popular with young people.
Because of the pandemic, many graduates will not be able to enjoy the sounds and sights of receiving their diploma in person, so they moved the ritual and all of its sensations online.
Statistics show that peak viewership of the 2.5 hour special event exceeded 35 million.
“Follow your heart, seize opportunities, don’t worry about the consequences, and you ’ll reap rewards you never expected.“
Although it was a song for graduates, it moved many non-graduates as well.
“After watching the whole presentation, I wanted to cry for the beauty and regrets of youth, because no matter what, they are worth remembering, yet we all have to find the courage to carry on.“
Natural Ecology in Beijing Continues to Improve, attracting More than 500 Kinds of Wildlife to "Settle" in the City - Ecns.cn

Natural ecology in Beijing continues to improve, attracting wildlife to "settle" in the city
Beijing now has more than 500 species of wild animals.
(Reporter Wang Bin) The Beijing Youth Daily reporter learned from the Beijing Gardening and Greening Bureau that in recent years, as the natural ecology of the capital continues to improve, the species and number of wild animals had also continued to increase.
At present, the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife inhabiting Beijing exceeds 500, including national first-level protected animals such as the brown-eared pheasant and black stork, as well as national second-class protected animals such as the goral, whooper swan, grey crane and mandarin duck.
Whether urban forests planted within the Second Ring Road or a small wetland embedded between buildings, it not only brings nature's rustic charm to the citizens of the capital, but also attracts wild animals to "settle" in the city.
In the summer, the Songshan Nature Reserve in the Yanshan Mountains in the north-west of Yanqing District is full of life.
A raccoon dog is playing by a creek, while two badgers are playing with each other nearby.
When looking back, you can see that a wild boar, unable to resist the "itch" on its body, is rubbing against a tree. Hu Qiaoli, Director of the Songshan Nature Reserve Management Office, said that by the end of 2019, 178 species of wildlife, including the golden eagle, a national first-level protected animal, as well as the koklass pheasant and gazelles, national second-level protected animals, have been living in this green zone with a total area of more than 6,200 hectares, and nearly a third of wildlife species in Beijing could be found here.
"Here in Songshan, wild animals are the real 'owners' and our staff can at best be thought of as their 'bodyguards'. ”
Hu Qiaoli said, in order to understand the situation of wildlife in the reserve, more than 30 professional patrol members patrol along 16 specifically developed protection routes every day, and every month there is a major one-day round trip for them to walk through almost the entire reserve.
"During the patrols, they not only check and record the biodiversity, but also the conditions of artificial bird nests, in addition to rescuing injured wildlife, installing infrared cameras in the field, and so on. ”
Now, the Songshan Nature Reserve has more than 200 infrared cameras to record the living conditions of wildlife in the forest.
Hu Qiaoli said that as the reserve's biodiversity has improved over the past few years, more and more wild animals have appeared on camera, with leopard cats, raccoons dogs, and hog-nosed badgers becoming "regular guests"; meanwhile, the goral, a national second-level protected animal, has been captured even more frequently.
Zhang Zhiming, Director of the Wildlife and Wetland Protection Department of the Beijing Gardening and Greening Bureau, said that the number of terrestrial vertebrate wildlife in Beijing has increased from 461 species in 1994 to more than 500 species today, and that the number of wildlife species in Beijing has continued to increase in recent years.
The increasingly common presence of wildlife in the city is closely related to the continuous upgrading of urban greening in Beijing in recent years.
In particular, the new round of One Million Mu of forestation and greening construction, which began in 2018, intends to reshape the urban ecological environment, enhance the ecological functions of woodlands and greenbelts, and highlight the concept of being "close-to - nature".
The plan aims to achieve interconnection and interaction with the surrounding greenbelts, so that wild animals can easily "visit their relatives and friends", and the trees planted are nectar and food source plants that these animals love.
Agricultural Modernization in the Black Land - - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 26th, 2020 Title: Agricultural Modernization in the Black Land
In mid-summer, two planes that spray pesticides flew above the Ten Thousand Mu High-Yield Demonstration Field of the Second Work Station, Fifth Management Area, Youyi Farm, forming two white lines, and the large characters “The World ’s No.1 Farm ” were extremely clear as formed by the black rice seedlings in the green field.
Kong Lingqiang, Director of the Work Station, said that such planes were able to spray pesticides over 6,000 mu (400 hectares) of fields per day, the efficiency of which was eight times unmanned aerial vehicle, and hundreds of times that of human labor.
The farm is located in Youyi County, Heilongjiang Province, which is the largest grain production base of China, and judging from the swish of cutting the rice seedlings with sickles in the past to the rumble of motors today, we can see that China ’s traditional agriculture and farm have changed tremendously in the black land.
Apart from planes, satellites are also used in the modernized agricultural production of Youyi Farm.
Kong Lingqiang stated that on one hand, they utilized satellite remote sensing technology to achieve accurate fertilization and reduce inputs in agriculture and pollution; on the other, satellite navigation technology improves the standardized work of agricultural machines in the field.
During the production of rice this year, the farm extended the area utilizing satellite navigation unmanned driving transplantation technology to 30,000 mu (2,000 hectares) from 3,000 mu (200 hectares) last year.
Such technology enables more even transplantation of rice seedlings, which maximizes the use of sunlight and arable fields, saving RMB 16 on human labor per mu on average.
The attempt to use new information technologies and intelligent technologies in the farm ’s agricultural production is the largest agricultural machine group in China.
According to statistics, there are 49,000 agricultural machines held by the farms at present, and the overall mechanization rate is 99.8%.
The rates of using GPS satellite navigation for agricultural machines, accurate sowing in dry land, and using machines with high horsepower on dry land are all 100%.
“Green agriculture, smart agriculture, and digital agriculture are the directions of exploration in agricultural modernization, ”
Liu Hualian, President of Youyi Farm, said.
The key to agricultural modernization is scientific and technological advancements.
The Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation Bureau, on behalf of the farms it represents, has fully acted as the “aircraft carrier ” of modernized agriculture in recent years, and has firstly built a modern agricultural system characterized by scaled planting, standardized production, and industrialized operation.
In the suburb of Youyi County, there is an agricultural machine exhibition park covering an area of 350,000 square meters.
It exhibits more than 140 agricultural machines and tools introduced and used by the Heilongjiang Agricultural Reclamation Bureau over the past years.
Those agricultural machines, tools, and farms bear witness the modernization process of Chinese agriculture.
Sacrifice Individual Interests for the Greater Good: the Direct Impact on People to be Relocated in Jiangkou River, Hefei City, Anhui Province - - Xinhua Net
Hefei, July 26th, 2020 (Xinhua) Title: Sacrifice Individual Interests for the Greater Good: the Direct Impact on People to be Relocated in Jiangkou River, Hefei City, Anhui Province
Edited by Chen Shangying, Wang Liwu and Liu Xiacun
At 4 p.m. on July 25th, Fu Kunbao wore a pair of rubber boots which were covered with mud as he walked from the front room to the back, scurrying to pack items with his wife Zhou Yan.
“When we got the call asking us to relocated from our village cadres, I was cutting the grass in the field. ”
Fu Kunbao said that he rented over 60 mu field to plant rice, the growth of which was healthy, “I just sprayed the pesticide yesterday, the tools were even not packed. ”
Fu Kunbao pointed to the pesticide sprayer in the corner, “No one wants his home to be lost in a flood, but we have to sacrifice our own interests for the public good. ”
To cope with the continuous high water levels at Chaohu Lake and the possible strong downpour, Hefei City is preparing to use a joint embankment at Jiangkou River, where Fu Kunbao ’s home is located, to diverge the flood and save water.
The joint embankment of Jiangkou River is located in Feixi County, which is close to the bank of Chaohu Lake.
Thousands of villagers in Yandian Village and Sanhe Town will be relocated.
By 16: 00 on July 25th, the water level of Chaohu Lake, the fifth largest freshwater lake in China, was still 13.2 meters, 0.7 meter higher than the safety level.
The kitchen of Fu Kunbao ’s home was neat, with a bowl of pumpkin dishes on the table, and some eggs and vegetables in sauce in the fridge.
“I never thought I ’d have to move away, and the current water level of Jiangkou River looks safe. ”
Zhou Yan said that her house is a bungalow, and she hasn’t found a suitable place to store the large items for now.
“I can pack expensive and important items first, and the large items like the fridge and television can be placed at a neighbor ’s or relative ’s house which is at a higher elevation. ”
Wang Liwen, village cadre, helped Fu Kunbao make plans.
Wang Liwen was in charge of the relocation of 13 households, so he informed the villagers one by one, and confirmed the settlement plan with everyone.
The nearest resettlement place to Fu Kunbao ’s home is Suxiao Primary School in Yandian Village, which was two kilometers away.
Apart from the large items, the over 1,000 jin (500 kg) of grain and newly bought furniture was also a headache Fu Kunbao and his wife.
“We are going to move the grain to our relative ’s home, but we have no way to move the furniture. ”
After discussion, the couple placed several chairs beneath their new bed, raising it by about 0.5 meters.
At 6 p.m., Fu Kunbao began to move these items to his relative ’s home by tricycle, while Zhou Yan continued to pack at home.
At 11 p.m., the couple checked everything across the home, shut down the electricity, and left for the settlement place.
“We hope that the flooding ends soon, ”
Fu Kunbao said.
At 9: 30 a.m. on July 26th, this journalist saw at Jiangkou River that the local government was fully prepared to divert the flood.
Zhang Jike and Lin Xiaozhai Form a Team to Support Youth with Great Muscles - Xinhua Net
The inspiring competitive show for youth sports, We Are The One, was officially broadcast on Hunan TV on July 11.
The team leader Zhang Jike and Sports Assistant Lin Xiaozhai are from different fields, but worked together, and commenters Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui were each unique in their own way, but the appearance of the hardcore “enormous ” strength gin pole made the program more“ exciting ”.
During the first episode, 11 young athletes came to the strength arena, and their appearance stunned the audience while arousing significant attention to their “fierce conflict ”“ robust confrontation ”, and “strong hearts ”.
Among them, the “fierce conflict ” was from the awe-inspiring student athlete Qiao Wenyi, who publicly provoked“ handsome boy ” Xu Zhibin on the same racetrack with him when he joked that Xu Zhibin should be on a singing and dancing show, insulting his competitor ’s appearance, and even saying that “if you lose, don’t cry or your make-up will run ”.
His words made all the young people and sports officials gasp.
The “robust confrontation ” was more like a battle between masters, with“ Big Devil ” Sun Jianqi competing against the formidable Zhang Xindong in a stunning match.
Their identity was also surprising, with Sun Jianqi an actor who is passionate about fitness, while Zhang Xindong is a retired commando who has won military medals three times.
At the start of the match, the two pulled on the small gin pole with all their strength, and the audience was anxious to see their more intense confrontation at the large gin pole.
The atmosphere was tense as one of the hosts of the program, Zhang Jike, also watched the battle intently.
When giving commentary, he was very careful, patiently encouraging the loser and helping him review his mistakes.
But sports assistant Lin Xiaozhai was a marvelous helper, who never concealed her appreciation for these good-looking and competitive young athletes.
After learning about their over-loaded daily training, she admired them a lot.
The other team leaders, Lin Dan and Fu Yuanhui, were each unique in their own way, with one being a calm “predictor ”, while the other was the“ bubbly optimistic girl ” who eased the tension with her warm smile.
As sports assistants, Jike and Liu Ye also discussed several funny topics around young athletes.
Fire in Cathédrale Saint-Pierre - et-Saint - Paul de Nantes, France: Parochial Volunteer Who was Kind and Taciturn Confessed to Arson-Ecns.cn
July 26 (Ecns.cn) According to reports from foreign media, on July 18, the Cathédrale Saint-Pierre - et-Saint - Paul de Nantes, a religious, historical, and architectural treasure, was seriously damaged in a fire, and the great organ was completely destroyed.
On the 26th (CET), Nantes prosecutors announced that a parochial volunteer who was responsible for the security of the cathedral had been charged with "arson and destruction."
The suspect has already pleaded guilty.
According to the report, the local prosecutor Cenas said that the 39 - year-old parochial volunteer from Rwanda admitted that he had set fire to three places in the cathedral at night.
His lawyer said that the arsonist now regrets doing such a thing.
He entered France via an asylum claim a few years ago, was sheltered in the parish where the fire happened, and was taken in by the church.
Prosecutors noted that recently, the suspect tried to update his visa and was in the process of dialogue with the police.
But workers in the cathedral couldn’t believe that the believer, who was kind and taciturn, would destroy the church he loved so much.
On the day of the fire on July 18, the volunteer was questioned by police about inconsistencies in his narrative, but he was later released.
Image shows rescue by firefighters at the scene.
On the evening of the 25th, the man was again subpoenaed as a result of new evidence obtained by professional engineers of the laboratory of the Paris Central Police Station.
This time, the man admitted to his arson.
If convicted of the crime of deliberate arson and destruction, the suspect will face 10 years' imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
It was reported that the fire caused serious damage to the Cathédrale Saint-Pierre - et-Saint - Paul de Nantes: the pipe organ in the church was completely burned and the stained glass window behind the pipe organ was also seriously damaged.
Brunel, the chief architect of French Built Heritage Conservation, believes that a conservative estimate of the required cathedral restoration work would take at least three years.
Comprehensive News: The Unilateralism of the United States Destroys Sino-US Relations, International Opinion Supports China ’s Countermeasures - - Xinhua Net
BEIJING, July 26, 2020 (Xinhua, by foreign correspondents) On the morning of July 24, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People ’s Republic of China announced to the US Embassy in China its decision to withdraw its consent for the establishment and operation of the US Consulate General in Chengdu, and the Ministry also made specific requirements for the cessation of all operations and events by the Consulate General.
International opinion holds the view that the unilateralism adopted by the US severely disturbs normal Sino-US relations, and China ’s response to the irrational aggression of the US and its countermeasures against the US are proper and essential.
Andres Borquez, Directer of the China Research Center, Institute of International Studies at the University of Chile said that the unilateralism of the US destroyed the bridge between the people of the two countries, leading to the current crisis in Sino-US relations.
Therefore, China ’s announcement of its closure of the General Consulate of the United States in Chengdu is a countermeasure against such unilateralism which conforms to the rules of foreign affairs.
Patricio Giusto, Professor of the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina and Director of China-Argentina Research Center held the view that,\ China ’s decisions were proper and essential countermeasures against the aggression of the US, which was not targeted at its general public.
The US tried to conceal their bad countermeasures against COVID - 19 by exerting pressure on China to shift its public attention.
Bambang Suryono, Chairman of the Asian Creative Research Center, a think-tank in Indonesia, said that the aggressive attitude of the US severely disturbs normal Sino-US relations and brings about severe challenges.
Thus, China ’s announcement of its closure of the General Consulate of the United States in Chengdu is a normal countermeasure which conforms to the rules of foreign affairs and shows China ’s principle and stance to firmly defend their self-interests whilst embodying its rationality and principled position, and China ’s etiquette of China ’s coping with foreign affairs.
Francis Semwenza, a current affairs commentator of Tanzania, said that, China ’s decisions were proper and essential responses to the aggression of the US.
For the re-normalization of Sino-US relations, the US government should actively improve its relationship with China, and quit its intervention in China ’s domestic affairs.
The US government should focus more on win-win situations in both economic growth and politics, as well as benefiting people of both the two countries and even the whole global community.
Ali Yousif, Executive Director of the Sudan-based Association of Arab-Chinese Friendship, said that, the countermeasures forced to be taken were proper and essential responses to the irrational behavior of the US, which conformed to the basic rules of the international law and international relations, as well as the rules of foreign affairs.
The requirement to close the General Consulate of China in Houston seriously disobeyed the basic rules of the international law and international relations.
And he hoped the US would cancel the relevant decisions and create necessary conditions for the re-normalization of Sino-US relations.
An editorial in Singapore ’s Lianhe Zaobao said that the broader strategic blueprint of the US was to contain China, and prohibit its continuous rise.
In face of the increasingly tight aggression, China was unwilling to witness the continuous deterioration of Sino-US relations, but it had no other choice but to take countermeasures.

July 26 (China News) According to reports in foreign media, hurricane “Hanna ” landed in Texas at 5: 00 p.m. local time on July 25th, bringing strong breeze and rainstorms, surges, and life-threatening flash floods to Texas.
According to the National Hurricane Center, Hanna is expected to carry rainstorms across parts of southern and northeastern Texas, causing surges and life-threatening flash floods.
It was reported that the area from the south of Corpus Christi to the estuary of the Rio Grande River was the area most seriously affected by Hanna, while large flash floods may break out in the Rio Grande Valley.
Abbott, governor of Texas, said on July 25th: "Any hurricane is a huge challenge."

Poland to Withdraw from the European Treaty on Violence against Women
Poland will take steps next week to withdraw from the European Treaty on the Prevention of Violence against Women, the country's Justice Ministry said Saturday.
Poland's right-wing government cabinet said the treaty violated the rights of parents by requiring schools to teach students about gender issues.
Justice Minister Ziobro said at a press conference that his ministry will submit a request on Monday to the Ministry of Labor and the Family to begin withdrawing from the treaty.
That treaty is also called the Istanbul Convention.
Ziobro said, ” The treaty contains elements which we consider to be of a harmful and ideological nature ”
Law and Justice, the ruling party of Poland, and its coalition partners have a close alliance with the Roman Catholic Church and advocate a conservative social agenda.
Polish president Duda made hostility to gay rights one of the main issues during his successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of Polish people (mostly women) protested against withdrawing from the convention in Warsaw and other cities.
"The purpose of withdrawing from the treaty is to legalize domestic violence," Lempart, one of the organizers of the protest, said during a protest march in Warsaw.
Some protesters carried banners that said "Law and Justice is women's hell."
Law and Justice has long complained about the Istanbul Convention.
Poland's previous centrist government ratified the convention in 2015.
Law and Justice says the treaty does not respect religion and requires liberal social policies to be taught in schools.
But so far, the party has not decided to withdraw from the convention.

BEIJING, July 26, 2020 (Xinhua, by Ni Yuanjin) July 26 marks the beginning of “Zhongfu (the second phase of Sanfu) ” this year.
During the small hours of July 26, the convective weather caused by strong wind and sudden downpours dispersed the intense heat that had lasted for several days; the rain will last for another several days.
According to the report from the Beijing Meteorological Service released at 11: 00 on July 26, there will be scattered showers on July 26 in Beijing (with weak thunder and lightning), and the highest temperature will be just 27 degrees Celsius; at night, it will be cloudy with light to moderate rain (with weak thunder and lightning), and the lowest temperature will be 23 degrees Celsius.
However, on July 24 and 25, Beijing was under a blue alert for high temperature; the highest temperature of most regions was 37 degrees Celsius, while some regions were even hotter, with a temperature of over 40 degrees Celsius.
Sanfu is the period with the highest temperature and humidity within a year, consisting of “three phases ” every year, the second of which is the hottest, the period when people“ lose their appetites ”.
As the sanfu days draw near, people always fill their homes with diverse grains, and “eating dumplings for the first phase of Sanfu, while eating noodles for the second ” is a long-lasting folk custom.
According to current weather reports, in the next three days, there will be clouds and rain in Beijing.
The meteorological service reminds us that mountain tours should be reduced in case of geological disasters.
It is estimated that the second phase of Sanfu will last for 20 days, from July 26 to August 14.
During these days, people always feel feeble and have no appetite.
Therefore, mung beans and coix seeds should be eaten to clear the heat, invigorate the spleen, and stimulate the appetite, and bitter foods such as sow thistle and bitter gourd can also be eaten for the same functions.
FAA launches urgent investigation of 2,000 passenger jets due to possible engine stalling - Xinhuanet
On the 24th, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an emergency Airworthiness Directive demanding an urgent inspection of the roughly 2,000 737NG and 737 Classic airliners registered in the US due to the fact that corrosion of the airliners ’ air check valves may cause the engines to stall while in midair.
The FAA said it has received reports of 4 incidents of 737NG and 737 Classic aircraft engines stalling in midair, so it has issued the emergency inspection order for all passenger aircraft that have been idled for 7 days or more or reactivated aircraft which have made fewer than 11 flights.
The FAA warned that if the Level 5 check valves in both engines of a passenger airliner become corroded, they may become stuck in the open position, causing the aircraft to completely lose power and be unable to restart its engines.
The regulatory agency ’s order stipulates that if a check valve is found to be corroded, this critical component must be immediately replaced by the operator before the airplane may be returned to service.
Boeing responded later the same day, saying that because many aircraft had been idled or used less frequently due to the lower demand for travel caused by the COVID - 19 epidemic, “which can make check valves more susceptible to corrosion ”.
At the same time, Boeing stated it has advised all operators to immediately inspect aircraft affected by the order, and if problems are discovered, Boeing will provide repair, replacement air check valves, and similar assistance.
The AP reported that aircraft owned by major US carriers typically fly several times a day, but due to the COVID - 19 epidemic, a large number of airlines have been idled; as return for travel has gradually started to return, some of these aircraft have been returned to service.
Details of the 4 reported stalling incidents were not released by the FAA.
Later on the 24th, Alaska Airlines disclosed that one of the incidents occurred on their aircraft.
The airline released a statement claiming that as its aircraft was flying from Seattle, Washington to Austin, Texas, one of the engines suddenly stalled, and the aircraft finally made an emergency landing in Austin.
Alaska Airlines said it had already replaced the aircraft ’s engine and had inspected the engines of 6 more aircraft as directed by the FAA.
On the 24th, American Airlines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines stated they had not experienced air check valve-related engine stalling on their aircraft.
Four American Airlines aircraft will be inspected, and 28 United Airlines aircraft will be inspected.
Delta Airlines declared that it will inspect the 20 affected aircraft it operates, but that no stalling incidents had occurred on its aircraft.
Reports from several press bureaus note that the FAA emergency Airworthiness Directive was another blow to Boeing.
Indonesia ’s Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines each experienced a Boeing 737 Max crash in October 2018 and March 2019, respectively, with a total of 346 fatalities.
Flights of this model were subsequently grounded globally, production ceased in January of this year, and was resumed in May of this year.
FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson admitted in June that the FAA “made a mistake ” in its supervision of the 737 Max.

Chief Secretary for Administration of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: all-out efforts to combat epidemic at critical juncture - Ecns. cn
HONG KONG, July 26 (Xinhua) - - Chief Secretary for Administration of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said on July 26 that the situation of COVID - 19 in Hong Kong continued to be severe, and if the epidemic turned worse, the HKSAR Government would decisively enact more stringent control measures to further restrict business operations and reduce the activity space for people.
But at present, the SAR government has no intention to enact a "Stay-at - Home Order" or "Restriction Order" that restrict people from going out.
Cheung Kin-chung published a weblog post on the same day entitled All-out efforts to combat epidemic at critical juncture.
He said the current wave of the outbreak was the most serious one over the past six months and the coming fortnight would be crucial in the fight against further spread of the coronavirus in the community.
While the Government would take all necessary measures in this battle, it was equally important for the public to exercise self-discipline and cooperation.
He earnestly urged members of the public to stay home as much as possible, minimize social contact, and refrain from dining out.
In compliance with the compulsory measures, citizens should wear a face mask to protect themselves and others while observing personal and environmental hygiene and washing their hands frequently, and should also suspend non-essential social or meal gatherings and reduce their visits to markets.
He emphasized that the Central Authorities had all along taken heed of the changes in Hong Kong ’s epidemic situation and staunchly supported the anti-epidemic work of the HKSAR Government, and in response to the recent request of the Chief Executive, the Central Authorities offered timely assistance in enhancing the virus testing capacity and retrofitting AsiaWorld-Expo into a makeshift facility similar to the “mobile cabin hospital ” on the Mainland.
Meanwhile, he stated that the Government ’s initiative to provide free COVID - 19 testing for designated high-risk groups was running at full steam, which would cover some 400,000 persons including staff of residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs), residential care homes for persons with disabilities, as well as nursing homes, restaurant workers, taxi drivers, and property management staff.
He was very concerned about the recent emergence of local infection cases in RCHEs, so to meet such needs, the Government has arranged to set up designated temporary quarantine centers.
He also said that quarantine facilities were being built in the vicinity of Penny ’s Bay Quarantine Center at Lantau Island, and 700 additional units were expected to be available by the end of September.
The Chief Executive also announced on the 19th that the Government would build an additional 2,000 units at Penny ’s Bay and strive to complete them by the end of this year.
With the commissioning of 800 quarantine units constructed on the Government land, the total number of quarantine units provided at Penny ’s Bay will add up to 3,500.
Currently, a total of about 2,600 units are in operation under four quarantine centers in Hong Kong.
Besides, Lei Yue Mun Park and Holiday Village on Hong Kong Island has been converted into community isolation facilities since July 24 for COVID - 19 patients who are under the age of 50 with self-care capabilities.

History is the best textbook, and for members and cadres of the Party, the history of Party and New China are the brightest chapters in this textbook.
Every member and cadre of the Party must continuously strengthen their historical thinking of using history as a mirror and moving towards the future, based on the new journey and new mission, accept the "relay baton" of the times, and walk the long march of the new era.
We must cast the soul with history, and stick to the original mission in the study of the history of the Party and New China.
Looking through the history of the Party and New China, we find it is full of the eternal and unchanging original aspiration and founding mission of the Chinese Communists and the adherence to rock-solid convictions, which demonstrates the simple desire of the Communists to walk with the people forever.
To understand important events, important meetings, and important figures in the history of the Party and New China up close is not only an intuitive baptism of thought, but also a deep understanding of the connotations of the original aspiration and the weight of the founding mission.
For the Party members and cadres, if they want to continuously forge their original aspiration and founding mission and maintain their advanced qualities, they must find the starting point and the fulcrum of our original intention from the history of the Party and New China, maintain a clear understanding and a firm stand, and find the strength to fight bravely for the country and the people and ensure that the red world their revolutionary ancestors laid down with their blood and lives will be passed on from generation to generation.
Studying history can make people wise, so we can inherit the noble spirit in the study of the history of the Party and New China.
Since the founding of the Communist Party of China, it has successively shaped a series of great spirits such as the Red Boat Spirit, the Jinggangshan Spirit, the Long March Spirit, the Yan 'an Spirit, the Anti-Japanese War Spirit, the Xibaipo Spirit, the "Two Bombs and One Satellite" Spirit, and the Aerospace Spirit.
These great spirits precipitated by history have provided the Party with a powerful spiritual incentive to overcome various risks and challenges on the way forward, and are a precious spiritual wealth that cannot be defeated, washed away, or taken away.
The process of studying the history of the Party and China is a process of reviewing these spirits and shaping one's own spirit; we must conscientiously use the lofty spirit of the revolutionary ancestors as a mirror, stay true to the spiritual home of the Communists, and lay a solid spiritual foundation for advancing the great cause and realizing the great dream, and we should also inherit and carry forward these spirits, and make them glow with the light of the new era.
Reading history can make people reflect; we must continue to preserve righteousness and dispel evil in the study of the history of the Party and New China,.
For Party members and cadres, there has never been any history that can deliver more profound warning, enlightenment, and reference than the history of the Party and New China.
In the history of the Party and New China, we can see the great deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries who were determined to devote themselves to their faith and persevere in striving to achieve the established goals, but we also see the profound lessons of certain figures who were shaken in their ideals and beliefs and came to the opposite side of the revolution, which enlighten and warn us never to stop or slack off in our firm determination and will, always maintain a strong fighting spirit, continuously purify the spirit of the Party, and be self-disciplined.
To truly become a firm believer and loyal practitioner of the lofty ideals of communism, one needs to clean off ideological “dust ” and guard against“ dirt ”; the history of the Party and New China should become the basis for every Party member and cadre to examine and warn himself.
Knowing history can inspire people; we should bravely take on the important tasks of the times in the study of the history of the Party and New China.
General Secretary Xi Jinping once pointed out, "Learning the history of the Party and the country is a compulsory course for upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and continuing to advance the various undertakings of the Party and the country."
Looking back at history and seeking our original aspirations allows us to maintain our glory and move towards a bright future.
Every Party member and cadre should adopt the study of the history of the Party and New China as lifelong pursuit, constantly set the course of life in their studies, and bravely assume the historical mission, dare to assume responsibility, and act proactively in our respective jobs.
We should adhere to the reference and guidance of the advanced deeds of the older generation of revolutionaries, constantly refine the political nature of the communists, maintain the attitude of struggle in seizing the day and making every effort, and the spirit of struggle in spite of the difficulties and hardships; in the great journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, we must write a brilliant stroke of our own.
“The Great Wall of Jiangnan ”, seeking the poetry of the“ Yellow River Dream ” - chinanews.com
(China poverty reduction story) “The Great Wall in Jiangnan ”, seeking the poetry of the“ Yellow River Dream ”
China News Service, Yinchuan, reported July 26 (Yang Di) “Countless li of sands along the Yellow River ’s endless turns as waves and wind rush onward from the horizon.“
The Yellow River, which has inspired the passions of countless poets, birthed the beautiful and bountiful Ningxia Plain, and today, Ningxia, which bears the fond epithet “The Great Wall of Jiangnan ”, upholds the concept of“ environment first, green development ” as it pursues the poetry of the “Yellow River Dream ”.
The “Jade Dream ” of clear river water
“The Yellow River brings all under heaven to enrich Ningxia ” as it runs its 397 km course through the province, making it the“ mother river ” that provides the region ’s resources.
However, because of rapid industrialization and urbanization, the utilization, management, and protection of rivers and lakes has become imbalanced, with factors such as excessive sewage, land reclamation, and invasive practices leading to black and smelly waters, declining water quality, dirty natural environments, and ecological degradation.
Today, Ningxia is working to restore a wide variety of water bodies, and striving to make the Yellow River flow with clear, beautiful water.
Treating the waters begins at the source.
In Ningxia ’s Yinchuan, through a “raising standards + cleaning up pollution + strict management ” method, all wastewater from industrial parks is collected and treated, all urban water treatment plants have achieved Class A discharge standards, bodies of dark and smelly water in built-up urban areas have essentially been eliminated, and the city ’s application to be included in the Third Batch of China Model Cities for Dark and Odorous Water Management has been approved.
In addition, in 2017, Ningxia comprehensively implemented its long-distance lakes and rivers management regulation, and has now achieved full coverage of its five-level responsibility system for these regulations across all urban and rural areas, meaning that long-distance river and lake patrols have become a common site.
Gu Jincheng, 64, a resident of a village near the Yellow River, has personally witnessed the river ’s transformation, and says, “The water used to stink, but after cleaning and treatment, the smell is gone.“
He says that with an improved environment, his life has become more comfortable, and he now often takes walks with his relatives by the Yellow River, where they appreciate the clear water and blue skies.
The “Wetland Dream ” of sand and circling gulls
Birds, green trees, wooden roads, clear water... the beautiful Ningxia scenery described in Fan Zhongyan ’s “Sand, Geese, and Feathers Chronicle ” has become a reality in the Yellow River Wetland Park in Yinchuan, Ningxia.
As the Yellow River flows through Ningxia, it forms river wetlands, lake wetlands, marsh wetlands, and other wetlands along its route, which play a critical role in the rational management of water resources and maintaining ecological balance, and internationally, have also become important stops on the migration routes of birds.
Since 2009, the related departments in Ningxia have invested a total of 3.45 billion RMB in wetland protection projects; presently, Yinchuan ’s wetlands cover 19,200 hectares, of which 78.5% are protected areas; Yinchuan has nearly 200 natural lakes and marsh wetlands, has 5 national wetland parks, 1 national urban wetland park, 6 autonomous region wetland parks, and 8 municipal parks.
Deputy director of the Yinchuan Wetland Conservation Center Lu Jinhu expressed to this reporter that wetland protection has increased biodiversity, which is especially apparent in the variety of bird species, “The relict gull is endangered, with just over 20,000 left in the world, of which more than 2,000 nest in Yinchuan wetlands.“
Ningxia has also passed laws that delineate a 500 - meter “red line ” wetland protection zone on both sides of the Yellow River, and which bans all development, construction, and business activities in the protected zone except for public welfare projects.
Zhao Shaoyong, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Conservation Service Center, says that source management of pollution, overall restoration and improvement of lake and river ecosystems, and wetland terminal construction, 100% of the water flowing in Ningxia ’s 9 major drainage channels into the Yellow River reaches Class IV standards, and he adds, “Now the water is clear, fish swim in it, and flowers bloom around it.“
The “Drinking Water Dream ” of universal livelihood improvement
Yinchuan in Ningxia once bore an “awkward ” honorific: the only city to look out on the banks of the Yellow River that lacks drinking water.
Starting in 2010, Yinchuan faced perennial water shortages during the peak summer season, and over the past decade, this water shortage has become a painful summer experience for many high-rise dwellers, but with all major water sources extremely stressed and the city ’s drilling and exploitation of huge areas of groundwater, water shortages were a significant problem for Yinchuan.
But thanks to the improvements in the quality of the Yellow River ’s water, purifying the river water has become a way to supply drinking water to local residents.
Ding Ming, deputy director of Yinchuan Water Affairs Bureau, said that to meet Yinchuan ’s demand for residential water, Ningxia initiated the Yinchuan Municipal Western Water Supply Line project in time to replace the city ’s original groundwater supply with high-quality water from the Yellow River.
“The project officially began supplying water to Yinchuan on December 29, 2019, and in 2020, the residents of Minning Town and Helan County also began to drink Yellow River water. ”“
Ding Ming said that the Yinchuan Water Conservation Department is considering integrating urban water supply and rural drinking water provision, stating, “Our next step is to integrate the scattered water supplies in rural areas and connect them to the Western Water Supply Line Project, and by the end of the year, we expect to essentially integrate all of Yinchuan ’s urban and rural water supply systems.“
To Reinforce Accountability, All Departments to Consolidate Flood Control and Relief Efforts-ChinaNews.com
To Reinforce Accountability, All Departments to Consolidate Flood Control and Relief Efforts
From cctv.com (CCTV News): According to information from Ministry of Water Resources, at noon today (July 25), water levels at the section below Wangjiaba on the Huaihe River main stream exceeded the warning level by 0.64 to 3.31 meters, and water levels below Shashi City on the mid and lower main stream of the Yangtze River and in Hunan and Hubei provinces the warning level by 0.05 to 2.02 meters.
Since Taihu Lake first went over the warning water level on June 28, it has remained so for 28 days.
At 12: 00pm today, the average water level of Taihu Lake was 4.67 meters, 0.02 meters over the safe water level.
Today, after thorough discussion and judgment, State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters decided to maintain the Level II Response for Yangtze River and Huaihe River flood control, meaning all jurisdictions are to be held accountable for further implementing flood control and disaster relief measures.
Today, the Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters and Ministry of Emergency Management dispatched specialist drainage vehicles from Shangdong, Zhejiang, and Fujian to help Jiangxi with problems like urban waterlogging caused by the heavy rainfall.
The United States Launches an Anti-Subsidy Investigation Against China with "Undervalued RMB Exchange Rate" for the First Time
The US Department of Commerce recently announced that it has decided to initiate anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations into Chinese strapping products, as well as an investigation on the "undervalued RMB exchange rate" project.
China's Ministry of Commerce pointed out that this is the first time that the United States has launched an anti-subsidy case to investigate the so-called "undervalued RMB exchange rate" project, and China is firmly opposed to this.
China's Ministry of Commerce issued a special press release on the evening of the 23rd, saying that China implements a managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand, with reference to a basket of currencies, and that the market plays a decisive role in the formation of exchange rates.
“On the whole, the RMB exchange rate is at a reasonable and balanced level and is not undervalued, ” the press release stressed.
Since 2005, the RMB has appreciated by more than 17% against the US dollar.
According to data released by the Bank for International Settlements, from the beginning of 2005 to May 2020, the nominal effective exchange rate of RMB appreciated by 38% and the real effective exchange rate by 49%, making it the most powerful currency among the G20 economies and one of the currencies with the highest appreciation in the world.
The Ministry of Commerce pointed out that the exchange rate issue goes beyond the members' authority to conduct anti-subsidy investigations in accordance with the WTO rules.
In February this year, the United States amended its laws and regulations to conduct anti-subsidy investigations into other countries' exchange rates, which is suspected of violating WTO rules and has been opposed by many parties.
Even under U.S. regulations, the applicant's complaint contains a number of errors and lacks the necessary anti-subsidy elements such as financial aid, grant of benefits and exclusivity, the press release said.
China urges the US to abide by existing international rules and stop conducting anti-subsidy investigations on the so-called "undervalued RMB exchange rate".
The offshore and onshore RMB exchange rates fell sharply against the US dollar on the 22nd, both falling below the mark of USD $1 to RMB 7.0 as tensions between China and the US escalated.
It is a matter of concern whether the U.S. Department of Commerce's move is intended to push up the RMB.
The spot exchange rate of the RMB against the US dollar rose above 7.0 on the 23rd, closing at 6.9961.
The central parity rate of the RMB against the US dollar, which is regulated by the government, fell 17 basis points to 6.9938 on the 24th.

Lewis family: John Lewis was a “fighter for the least of us ”
At a memorial service held in his remembrance on Saturday, July 25th, US Congressperson and civil rights activist John Lewis was described as a “fighter for the least of us ”.
Public memorial services for Lewis have been open to the public since Saturday in Alabama.
On the first day, two memorial services were held.
At the memorial service held on Saturday at Alabama ’s Troy University, Lewis ’s five brothers and sisters and one grandson described him as a deeply caring and courageous family man.
Lewis ’s younger brother, Henry “Grant ” Lewis, said at the service,“ He dedicated his life to the service of others. “
Samuel Lewis said his mother warned Lewis, “Not to make trouble, don’t make trouble.“
He added that John ignored his mother ’s warning, and continued, “We all knew John would always make trouble, always get into trouble, but it was always to stand up for the right thing, so it was a good trouble.“
Lewis ’s brothers and sisters told those in attendance at the service that John ’s most famous point of argument was that people should create “good trouble ”, which is to say that he would never shy away from causing trouble for the sake of justice.
John once applied to Troy University in Troy, Alabama, where he was born, but he was rejected because it was an all-white school at the time.
John Lewis, who preached to chickens on his family farm as a child, finally earned his degree in religion and philosophy at Fisk University.
Several years later, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from Troy University.
Alabama Senator Doug Jones said current protestors are “protesting peacefully and non-violently ”, just as John Lewis protested during the Civil Rights Movement.
Jones continued, “Even though President Trump tarred all the protesters with the same brush by describing them as thugs, he was wrong.
The protesters are patriots who want America to become a more equal country. “
The six-day series of events to remember Lewis ’s life will conclude with a funeral in Georgia this week.
On Saturday, Lewis ’s coffin was exhibited at a public memorial service at Troy University, where members of the public came to pay their respects to this civil rights pioneer.
Later, on Saturday evening, a private memorial service was held for people to pay their respects at a church in Selma, Alabama, after which a private memorial service was held.
On Sunday, Lewis ’s remains will be carried across Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma.
In 1965, Lewis and several other demonstrators demanding the right to vote for Blacks were beaten viciously by Alabama police on this bridge, and the police also fired tear gas into the crowd.
Lewis was nearly killed by his injuries.
Later, that day became known as “Bloody Sunday ”.
Then, Lewis ’s remains will be shipped to Alabama ’s capital city Montgomery.
Mayor Steven Reed encouraged people to line up on the sidewalk to complete Lewis ’s final journey with him.
However, officials also reminded participants that they should wear masks and maintain social distance.
Alabama Governor Kay Ivey ordered that the state flag be flown at half-mast on Saturday and Sunday in honor of Lewis ’s memory.
During the near-week of memorial events, Lewis ’s remains will briefly visit the Alabama State Capitol in Montgomery, the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta, and the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington to allow members of the public to express condolences.
Last week, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that members of the public can visit the U.S. Capitol Building on Monday or Tuesday to pay their respects to Lewis.
Public memorial events for Lewis will be held outdoors due to the coronavirus epidemic.

Recently, General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized during an inspection in Jilin province that it was necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party, promote the extension of organizations of the Party to the most basic level, improve the work system of the New Party ’s basic organizations, and provide a strong guarantee for the governance of urban and rural communities.
Adhering to the guidance of Party building and implementing the Party's leadership in all fields and links of grassroots social governance is the fundamental requirement of doing a good job in grassroots social governance.
To improve the level of grassroots social governance, we should adhere to the leadership of Party building, promote the transformation of the Party's political, organizational, and mass work advantages into governance advantages by strengthening political leadership, building a battle fortress, and condensing red forces, so as to transfer the Party's strength and ideas to the "nerve endings" and the "last mile".
We must pay attention to calcium supplementation and soul forging and strengthen political leadership.
To strengthen the political leadership of grassroots social governance, it is necessary to implement the "calcium supplementation and soul forging" project.
It is necessary to deeply study and thoroughly understand Xi Jinping ’s thoughts on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era as the primary task, take “remain true to our original aspiration and keep our mission firmly in mind ” as the eternal theme of Party building and the lifelong theme of Party members and cadres, and strengthen the idea of reading the original work, learning the original text and understanding the principles; we should promote the solidification of the Party ’s innovative theories through special training, batch training, seminars, exchanges, holding forums, and so on; and Party members and cadres should further enhance the" Four Consciousnesses ", strengthen" Four-sphere Confidence ", and achieve the" Two Upholds "to better perform their duties and responsibilities.
Through the combination of online and offline learning methods, we should broaden the channels of learning and education, and guide the grassroots Party organizations and Party members and cadres to truly and regularly integrate learning and education into their daily activities.
We should pay attention to practice and address the problematic and disturbing issues that the masses are concerned about, and forge the Party ’s spirit and ability in the process of resolving key and difficult problems in the field of grassroots social governance,
We should improve our standards and play a key role in grassroots governance.
Grassroots Party organizations are not only an important part of the grassroots social governance system, but also an important carrier for the manifestation of governance capabilities.
To promote the standardized construction of grassroots Party organizations, we should start by grasping the regulations on the work of Party branches and addressing the problem of the leadership of Party organizations being weak and ineffective; we must consolidate the foundation, reduce the weaknesses, and promote development by establishing an up-down linkage mechanism, innovating the form of branch establishment, normalizing the weak and lax parts, establishing and improving decision-making and discussion mechanisms, and the mechanisms of serving the masses.
In rural areas, we should strengthen the standardization-building of village level Party organizations, standardize organizational forms, learning activities, and management mechanism in accordance with the standardization construction standards of Party branches, and earnestly promote the detailed implementation of “the system of holding Party branch general meetings, meetings of Party branch committees, Party group meetings, and Party lectures" and thematical Party activities.
In terms of urban governance, we should pay attention to sub-district communities, explore and innovate the form of branch establishment, focus on weak areas, "blocking points", and "pain points", and actively build the urban Party-building alliance to realize effective coverage of the Party's work.
At the same time, we should establish and improve the systems and mechanisms of grassroots social governance, improve the decision-making and discussion mechanisms for discussing major issues, doing practical things, deciding important matters, discussing urgent matters, and solving difficult matters led by grassroots Party organizations; we should improve the mechanisms of Party members and cadres to contact and serve the masses, gather people's hearts in serving the people, and enhance the sense of gain, happiness, honor, and pride of the masses to make grassroots social governance more enticing.
We should play a vanguard role and gather red power.
Grassroots party members and cadres are the cornerstone of grassroots social governance.
To improve grassroots social governance capabilities, we should focus on improving the governance capabilities of grassroots Party members and cadres, on the demonstration and leading role of "red cells" in grassroots social governance, and on gathering red forces at the forefront of contacting and serving the masses.
It is necessary to take the improvement of governance ability as a compulsory course for grassroots Party members and cadres, constantly strengthen ideological refinement, professional training, and practical training, the spirit of carrying forward the spirit of responsibility in their posts and in urgent, difficult, and dangerous tasks, and lay a solid foundation for and contribute to the modernization of the national governance system and governance capabilities.
It is necessary to extensively carry out the activities of "community whistleblowing, party members reporting", through participating in thematic Party activities, contacting people in difficult situations, determining service projects, acknowledging micro-desires, and making reasonable suggestions, to participate in community construction, management, and service, so that Party members can play a role in community governance.
It is necessary to give full play to the role of unemployed Party members in rural areas, and guide the majority of grassroots Party members to actively participate in poverty alleviation, ecological construction, petitioning and stability maintenance, and banning straw burning by setting up unemployed Party member vanguard posts and forming unemployed Party member work teams to better integrate red forces and serve the people.
The foundation is solid and the building is firm.
The grassroot Party organization is the foundation of the “ruling ” building.
Only by persisting in focusing on the close relationship between the Party and the masses, increasing the well-being of the people, and taking the leadership of Party building as the fundamental way to promote the innovation and development of grassroots social governance can we build a firm foundation and make grassroots Party organizations stable, make grassroots Party members and cadres responsible, and make grassroots governance spiritual, orderly, powerful, and effective.

Tibetan antelope migration season arrives in Hoh Xil
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, reported July 25th (Correspondent: Wang Jinjin) This reported learned from the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration Yangtze River Origin Park Hoh Xil Management Office Wudaoliang Conservation Station, that monitoring data from the station shows that the rutting and birthing season for Tibetan antelopes which previously migrated to the Zhuonai Lake area in the hinterlands of Hoh Xil is ending, and that the young antelopes are now gradually returning to their original habitats.
Monitoring images from areas near the Wudaoliang Conservation Station show that on July 25th, about 40 female Tibetan antelopes leading 3 calves crossed Kilometer Marker 3002 on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and the Wudaoliang North Bridge on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, indicating that Tibetan antelopes have already begun their return migration.
According to experts, in recent years, Tibetan antelope calves have made up a fifth to a quarter of the total herd migrating along the return route.
Lian Xinming, associate researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Northwest Plateau Biology Institute said, “During the return migration season, Tibetan antelopes are at higher risk of being hunted, so the number of calves is low, and sometimes there are none at all.“
Statistics from the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration Yangtze River Origin Park Hoh Xil Management Office show that the number of Tibetan antelopes on the return migration route has been increasing each year, with 4,860 counted in 2019, an increase of 338 over 2018.
Lian Xinming said, “This year ’s return migration of Tibetan antelopes is predicted to conclude in early September, and there is hope that the number will continue to rise.“
The Tibetan antelope is a national Level 1 protected species.
Each year in late May, Tibetan antelopes from areas Sanjiangyuan in Qinghai, Qiangtang in Tibet, the Altyn-Tagh mountain range in Xinjiang, and other areas migrate to Zhuonai Lake in the hinterland of Hoh Xil to breed and birth their calves.
According to Wu Xiaomin, a Chinese Tibetan antelope conservation expert and researcher at the Shaanxi Institute of Zoology (Northwestern Endangered Animals Research Institute), “The return migration of Tibetan antelopes is the process of female Tibetan antelopes leading their calves back to their original habitats after their birthing period. The herd that leaves the birthing ground is fairly large, but later, the Tibetan antelopes split into groups specific to different regions and return along separate routes to their original territories.“
This journalist learned that to ensure the safe return migration of Tibetan antelope herds, the Sanjiangyuan National Park Administration Yangtze River Origin Park Hoh Xil Management Office has arranged personnel to conduct continuing video surveillance and patrols along the primary migration routes.
If a herd is discovered attempting to cross a highway, the mountain patrol teams respond rapidly with traffic control measures to drive herds safely through wildlife crossings, so that they are disturbed by humans as little as possible during their migration.
So, how should we deal with heat in our daily lives?
According to experts, you should avoid going outside during the hottest part of the day during summer and avoid walking or labor in the sun before or after noon, because these periods of the day are when the sun is most intense and the possibility of heatstroke is highest.
If you can’t avoid going outside during these periods, take protection measures such as carrying a parasol, wearing a sun hat, wearing sunglasses, and applying sunscreen when possible to prevent burns.
For clothing, light-colored, breathable cotton, linen, and silk are best, while chemical fiber clothing should be avoided to prevent heatstroke due to insufficient heat dissipation when sweating profusely.
In hot, humid weather, have sufficient water ready and drink it before you feel thirsty, because feeling thirsty means your body is already dehydrated, while also ensuring that each mouthful is between 150 - 200ml, and drink warm, boiled water instead of ice-cold water.
Depending on temperature, the average person drinks 1.5 - 2L of water per day, while workers in high-temperature environments drink 3 - 5L per day.
At times of profuse sweating, add some salt to the water to make up for the salt your body loses through sweating.
In addition, the human body tends to be deficient in potassium in summer, which makes people feel tired and depleted, so drinking potassium-infused tea is an excellent way to relieve yourself from the heat.
During summer, eat vegetables with high water content such as lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, as well as fresh fruit such as peaches, apricots, watermelons, and melons, all of which have water content between 80 - 90%, which is helpful for rehydration, while dairy products can both rehydrate and provide the body ’s required nutrition.
People who work in high-temperature environments should also supplement their potassium, magnesium, and other nutrients with the appropriate beverages.
During the long days and short nights of summer, while temperatures are high, the body ’s metabolism ramps up and consumes more calories, making it easy to feel tired.
Getting sufficient sleep relaxes brain ’s and body ’s systems, which is beneficial to both work and study, and is a good way to prevent heatstroke.
Experts say the best time to fall asleep is between 22: 00 - 23: 00, and the best time to wake up is between 05: 30 - 06: 30.
Take care not to lie under air-conditioning vents or electric fans while sleeping to avoid air-conditioning sickness and thermal colds.
Experts advise that people who exercise outdoors or work in high-temperature environments carry Shi Di Shui, Ren Dan, Huo Xiang Zheng Qi Shui, Huo Xiang Zheng Qi Wan, or other heatstroke prevention medicines to with them or place them around their work environment and use them often to prevent heatstroke.

She said that the exhibited art works are from graduates from several art colleges, among which the works suitable for display in business spaces were especially selected; the formats range from easel painting and sculpture to new media equipment, interactive flash and VR panoramas, making it the year ’s most numerous and diverse exhibition by far.
Among the works, Li Yunxiao created The First War of 2020 using a mixed machine and manual production process to express his feelings of the pandemic; Liu Jiaying created Sound Money using the Ethereum block chain, which discusses themes including “cryptocurrency ”,“ credit creation ”, and “transactions ”; Cat Forest by Zhang Jiaqi and Barriers by Qiu Daqiang both describe how animals always stay with people, from which we can see how young artists comprehend the relationship between human beings and animals; the work The Winter of Belief - - Gift by Zhu Zhongyu reminds young people that“ even if you achieve great success in career, do not forget your primary inspirations, and always remain innocent and sincere. ”
Among the few graduates participating in the placement of the exhibition, Li Jingyin is from the Department of Sculpture at the Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts.
“I arrived in Beijing on July 7, and at the time I was a little worried about the pandemic, so took the nucleic acid test three days in advance, and I came here with alcohol pads and my test report. ”
His art work The Mysterious Yesterday is complex in its structure, and took a lot of work to produce.
At the same time, he also helped others to remedy defects in their art.
“I was busy with placement until 4: 30 a.m. and then worked on correcting defects, and the schedule was so tight that I even forgot to take photos with the works, which is a bit sad. ”
He hoped that, after the pandemic, he could go to see the exhibition of their works with his classmates.

Australian university develops new drug to treat COVID - 19 blood vessel blockage - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, reported July 26 (Correspondent: Chen Yu) Researchers at Australia ’s Monash University are developing a new drug to prevent stroke and heart disease, and it is hoped that the same drug can be used to treat blood vessel blockage caused by COVID - 19.
The researchers discovered that prior to a heart attack or stroke, an enzyme present in platelets accelerates platelet clotting.
To target this, they are developing medicine to temporary inhibit platelet clotting as a way to avoid clogging blood vessels and thereby prevent heart disease and stroke.
They claim the drug ’s inhibitive effect will only affect clotting when in the presence of signs of heart attack or stroke.
Studies indicate that such blood vessel blockage is a leading cause of death in severe COVID - 19 cases, so the researchers hope this drug can be use to treat such severe cases in the future.
At present, the drug shows promising results in animal studies, and the researchers are preparing for the next phase of experiments, human trials.
The results of their research were recently published in the US magazine “Science Translational Medicine ”.
He was the first spectator to enter a CBA venue after the league resume games and allowed in-person audiences.
On the day, at the second stage game of the 2019 - 2020 China Men ’s Basketball Professional League (CBA) semifinals (Laoshan Division) in Qingdao, Shandong Province, medical personnel, teachers, and public security officers went through the official ticket platform procedures, including nucleic acid testing, and afterward, he entered the court to watch the Shanghai Sharks play the Shandong Heroes.

CNS from Hami, Xinjiang, July 26 Xinjiang Ploughs in “Sunflower Fields ” to Take Advantage of Clean Energy
Over 6,000 pentagon heliostats, 48 square meters each, lined up in circles like a field of silver sunflowers, turning with the sun and reflecting sunlight to the 200 - meter heat absorption tower in the middle for power generation.
On the 25th, the reporter saw this view when visiting a CNEEC Hami molten salt tower solar power plant in Naomaohu Township of Yiwu County in Hami, Xinjiang.
“Molten salt tower solar power generation means to form thermal energy through specular concentrated sunlight reflection to the heat absorption tower, then turn the thermal energy into electricity through conventional power generation technology. ”
Zhang Yong, Vice GM of CNEEC Hami Solar Power Co., Ltd., said the design concept is similar to solar stoves used in Northwestern rural areas, which use concentrated sunlight.
Covering an area of 6,600 mu, the power plant, construction of which started in October 2017, was integrated into the grid at the end of last year, with a total of 14,500 heliostats ultimately to be installed.
“Compared to conventional solar power technology, its greatest advantage is to store collected thermal energy so that power generation can continue in the evening. ”
Zhang Yong said the 13 - hour thermal storage system deployed at this project is not affected by sunlight changes, enabling continuous stable operation of the generator unit, and can also swiftly support power grid peak stabilization according to grid load peak and valley demands.
Annual power generation of the project will reach 198 million kwh when completed, saving over 60,000 tons of standard coal, cutting over 60 tons of sulfur dioxide emission, 60 tons of oxynitrides, 20 tons of dust and fumes, and over 150,000 tons of carbon dioxide while providing a steady flow of clean energy to the locals.
Aside from that, there is another silver sunflower field in Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park in Hami City.
The Hami Fuguang Solar Photovoltaic Power Plant covers an area of over 2,300 mu, with 714 generators following the sun to always maintain a 90 degree right angle between sunlight and panels.
“We use dual-axis tracking CPV technology that through integrated controls, ensures all power generating equipment adjusts its angle to the altitude of the sun to maintain generating efficiency. ”
Duan Mengqi, head of the power plant, said in good lighting weather, this technology improves efficiency by 20% compared to conventional photovoltaic power generation.
In the first half of this year, the power plant generated over 7 million kwh of electricity and supplemented local power demand.
Shichengzi Photovoltaic Industrial Park is currently the largest demonstration park with the most comprehensive photovoltaic component types, and it currently hosts 38 photovoltaic power generation projects with a total installed capacity of 820,000kw.
In the first half of this year, it generated 110 million kwh, an increase of 6% compared to 2019.
Hami is one of the regions that has the best solar energy resources in China.
Its average annual solar radiation is over 6,200 MJ per square meter, with around 3,200 annual sunshine hours.
In recent years, Hami has focused on developing its photovoltaic industry and established “sunflower fields ”.
Installed solar power capacity is over 2.5 million kw, and its power generation exceeded 1.4 billion kwh in the first half of the year, 14% year-on - year growth.
At present, Xinjiang has more than 330 photovoltaic plants connected to the grid, with an installed capacity of over 10 million kw.
This year ’s power generation is expected to be 15 billion kwh, which can replace over 6 million tons of standard coal.

At the same time, according to relevant experts, tourists should follow the rules and be rational when doing outdoor activities, should pay attention to warning signs along the road at all times, not take the risk of entering deserted areas, and if there are emergencies, call the police immediately.
U.S. Media Unveils U.S. Unwarranted Demand to Shut Down Chinese Consulate General In Huston-ChinaNews.com

U.S. Media Unveils U.S. Unwarranted Demand to Shut Down Chinese Consulate General In Huston
On the 24th of this month, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs notifies United States ’ Embassy to China that it decided to revoke the license for the establishment and operation of the U.S. Consulate General in Chengdu, and outlines specific requirements to shut down all businesses and activities of the Consulate General in response to the sudden U.S. request to shut down the Chinese Consulate General in Houston on the 21st.
This action taken by the United States government has drawn broad attention, and its political motivation is questioned by foreign media and scholars.
What is the reason behind the demand for the Chinese Consulate General shutdown?
Several foreign media reported that the reason why the U.S. would select the Chinese Consulate General in Huston is unclear, but as to the purpose of this action, they stated straightforwardly that it was “for the election ”.
According to a CNN report on the 23rd, the request to shut down the Chinese Consulate General in Houston made people question the United States ’ political motives.
As the article states, U.S. government ’s disastrous response to the COVID - 19 pandemic has led to President Trump ’s sluggish support rate in polls prior to the election.
White House officials ’ private statements indicate that the tough position against China is to save Trump ’s support rate as well as to shift the focus away from the White House ’s failure in response to the pandemic.
The article believes Chinese Consulate General in Houston to be a “politically motivated and discreet ” target chosen by the U.S.“ to create a tough position while avoiding major conflicts ”.
The BBC also believes that with the U.S. election around the corner and the U.S. economy suffering badly due to the pandemic, Trump sees “playing the ‘ China card ’ as politically beneficial ”.
The current situation is a “spiraling tit for tat fight ”, which, driven by U.S. government ’s domestic considerations to some extent, will only worsen tensions between China and the U.S.
According to CBS, Trump ’s prospects for a second term is under pressure because of the pandemic, and he has repeatedly pointed his finger at China for the outbreak.
The U.S. has almost daily new actions based on Trump ’s absurd argument of so-called “China ’s exploitation of the United States ”.
“The Consulate General in Huston is important for building bilateral connections ”
As stated by the AP, the U.S. request to shut down Chinese Consulate General will aggravate tensions between two of the world ’s largest economies.
Besides the diplomatic impact, with the Chinese Consulate General in Houston shut down, Chinese citizens in the South will face difficulties accessing consular services, and so will U.S. citizens applying for visas or other services.
A business group in Huston expressed its regrets on this matter, saying the Consulate General plays a key role in bilateral trade, investment, and cultural connections.
The AP believes that it reflects the importance of China ’s economy.
According to the Foreign Policy website, this action by the U.S. is “part of a series of provocative moves that will only aggravate U.S. - China relations ”.
Reuters quoted Jonathan Pollack, East Asia expert of Brookings Institution, saying he couldn’t think of anything comparable to the United States action on the Chinese Consulate General in Houston since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1979.
The South China Morning Post in Hong Kong calls the U.S. action unprecedented in the 40 years of China-U.S. diplomatic relations.
Analysts believe this action could cause lasting damage.
The Chinese Consulate General in Houston was established in 1979 as the first Chinese Consulate General opened in the United Stated.
Currently, China has one Embassy and five Consulate Generals in the United States.

Spokesperson of the Embassy of the People ’s Republic of China in the UK: The Chinese Government is a Staunch Defender of Cyber Security-Ecns.cn
July 26, (Ecns.cn): According to the website of the Embassy of the People ’s Republic of China in the UK, on the 25th, the spokesperson of the Embassy of the People ’s Republic of China in the UK responded to reporters' questions about erroneous statements about cyber attacks.
The spokesperson emphasized that the Chinese government was a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
A reporter stated that according to the media, hacker organizations related to China had interfered with the network system of a British company, launched attacks on British and American technology companies that had patented data, and invaded the government networks of EU countries.
The spokesperson said that the Chinese government was a staunch defender of cyber security and has always resolutely opposed and combated any form of cyber attacks and cyber crimes.
Cyberspace is highly virtual, and it ’s difficult to trace with diverse actors, meaning sufficient evidence should be presented when investigating and identifying cyber incidents, and no unreasonable guesses should be made.
The spokesperson said that a series of incidents such as "Prism" in the past proved that the United States has been conducting the world's largest cyber theft.
Maintaining peace and stability in cyberspace was in line with the common interest of all countries.
The spokesperson pointed out that China's achievements in technological innovation were not stolen or robbed, but were obtained through self-reliance and perseverance.
In 2019, China submitted about 59,000 patent applications through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), with an annual growth rate of 10.6%, making it the country with the largest number of international patent applications.
China has become a country of innovation and intellectual property rights.
New loans to both farmers and small and micro enterprises in Xinjiang in the first half of the year exceeded the annual increase in 2019, according to data from the Urumqi Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank of China.
In the first half of this year, the Urumqi Central Sub-branch of the People's Bank of China used a variety of monetary policy tools to guide the banking industry in continuously increasing the loan supply, providing sufficient capital guarantees for COVID - 19 prevention and control and the resumption of work and production.
Free Nucleic Acid Testing Have Basically Been Completed in Most of Regions of Urumqi, Second Testing is Ongoing in High-risk Areas-Ecns.cn
URUMQI, July 26 (Ecns.cn, by Sun Tingwen, Zhao Yaomin): Zhang Wei, director of the Municipal Health Commission of Urumqi, reported on the state of the latest outbreak of pandemic and nucleic acid testing in Urumqi on the 26th, saying that at present, free nucleic acid testing work has been basically completed in most areas of Urumqi.
The expert group of the State Council and experts from the autonomous region and Urumqi are making further assessments of the development of the pandemic based on the results of the nucleic acid testing and epidemiological investigations.
The Press Office of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region held a press conference on the 26th to report on the pandemic situation and its prevention and control in Xinjiang.
According to him, there were 22 new confirmed COVID - 19 cases in Urumqi from 0: 00 to 24 on July 25 (including 5 confirmed asymptomatic cases), and 38 new asymptomatic cases.
As of 24: 00 on July 25, 135 cases were confirmed in Urumqi and 147 were asymptomatic.
The newly-added asymptomatic cases on the 25th were also basically discovered through free nucleic acid testing in the city.
Zhang Wei, director of the Municipal Health Commission of Urumqi, reported that free nucleic acid testing work has basically been completed in most areas of Urumqi.
He also said that from the experience of other regions in China, there are many factors that affect the results of nucleic acid testing, such as sensitivity of detection reagents, infection time and detoxification time of the tested people, cooperation of the tested people when the samples are taken (low level of cooperation may lead to failure to take the specimen), as well as the detection environment and the proficiency of the inspectors.
For various reasons, false negative results can also appear in nucleic acid testing.
False negative means that the person tested is indeed infected, but the results of the nucleic acid test are negative.
In addition, for those who have close contact with confirmed cases and suspected cases, it usually takes two nucleic acid tests to exclude them.
For those who have been to the high-risk areas for the pandemic, if fever and respiratory symptoms occur, there may be a possibility of false negatives in nucleic acid testing, so another nucleic acid test is needed.
He said that in view of the above situation, for the health of the people of all ethnic groups in the city, Urumqi would carry out two free nucleic acid tests in key areas such as Tianshan district and Saybag district, and carry out the work of “making up for deficiencies".
It is reported that Tianshan district and Saybag district are high-risk epidemic areas.

Fauci, White House pandemic expert: cautiously optimistic attitude should be held towards vaccine development in early 2021
Fauci made the above remarks at an online video conference hosted by the International Leadership Foundation on July 25th.
He warned that it was not clear how COVID - 19 would develop in the autumn and winter, nor what the ultimate impact of the pandemic would be, saying, "The only way to end all this is that we all choose to be part of the solution."

Fauci said some parts of the United States were struggling with a pandemic resurgence.
Although the pandemic situation varies from place to place and needs to be dealt with according to local conditions, diversified anti-pandemic strategies do not mean that there is no close connection between them.
The pandemic situation in one area will eventually affect other areas.
"This is not the time for complacency," Fauci said, "We have not finished our work, so we must step up our efforts and be alert regarding the uncertainty of the future. ”

Brazilian Study Indicates Hydroxychloroquine Ineffective in Treating Mild and Moderate COVID - 19 Illnesses-ChinaNews.com
Recently, a Brazilian study has shown that hydroxychloroquine is ineffective in treating COVID - 19 patients with mild and moderate symptoms.
The study report was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Brazilian researchers put 667 patients from 55 hospitals across the country into 3 groups for clinical trials to compare the effectiveness of treatment using hydroxychloroquine only and through hydroxychloroquine combined with other antibiotics (azithromycin) to see if it was helpful in improving COVID - 19 patients ’ mild and moderate conditions.
The results show that not only is hydroxychloroquine not helpful, it can have damaging side effects on the body's organs.
This research was a collaboration between multiple prestigious Brazilian hospitals, such as Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, HCor, Hospital Sírio-Libanês, and BCRI, and BRICNet.
On the 25th (local time), Brazilian President Bolsonaro announced negative results of his forth NAAT test on social media.
While infected, Bolsonaro took hydroxychloroquine and actively recommended it on multiple occasions.

Four departments begin new round of app governance to protect personal information security - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, reported July 25th (Correspondents: Yu Junjie and Chen Aiping) On the 25th, the correspondents learned from the Cyberspace Administration of China that the 2020 governance work over apps that illegally collect and use personal information recently began, and will focus on cracking down on serious problems reported by the public such as apps that surreptitiously upload private information in the background.
Sources state that this round of app governance work will be a joint action by four departments: the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Public Security, and the State Administration for Market Regulation.
According to sources, the special governance work group made up of these four departments handled over 12,000 reports by netizens last year, inspected 2,300 apps, and for 260 especially problematic apps with large userbases, applied penalties such as public exposure, discussions, and removal from app markets.
As reported by the responsible party at the Cyberspace Administration of China, there are currently more than 5 million apps, and the problem of illegal collection of personal information has not been resolved at a fundamental level.
In 2020, governance work will be expanded beyond app verification to include SDK ’s (software development kits), applets, and so on.
Sources further state that the working group will conduct dedicated research and in-depth inspection of topics such as the irregular collection and use of personal biometric information and the abuse of sensitive permissions by apps, and will focus on background permission abuses such as sound recording and photography.
Based on the circumstances surrounding problems discovered and the severity of their consequences, the working group will impose legal remedies such as discussions, warnings, removal from app markets, and fines, which will form an effective deterrent to such illegal behaviors.
Sources continue, stating that the working group plans to issue app market review and management instruction regarding app collection of personal information which will guide and encourage app markets to properly conduct pre-launch review of apps and strictly control listings.
The work group will also publish free technology tools to help small and medium-sized enterprises conduct self-assessment of their collection of personal information and improve legal compliance.
Johns Hopkins University: the Total Number of Confirmed Cases of COVID - 19 in the World Exceeds 16 million - - Xinhua Net
New York, July 26 (Xinhua) According to statistics published by Johns Hopkins University in the United States, as of 02: 40 on July 26 (Eastern Standard Time), which is 14: 20 of July 26 (Beijing Time), the total number of confirmed cases of COVID - 19 in the world was 16,048,100, and the total death count was 644,537.
According to the statistics, the pandemic in the United States is the most severe, with 4,178,027 confirmed cases and 146,460 death cases in total.
The total number of confirmed cases in Brazil was 2,394,513 and total deaths were 86,449, and both the two sets of data were second after the United States.
Besides, countries with more than 300,000 confirmed cases in total include India, Russia, South Africa, Mexico, Peru, Chile, and the United Kingdom.
On July 25, the 2020 Hunan Red Tourism Culture Festival and the First Xiangtan Red Culture Industry Expo was held in Shaoshan.
In recent years, the demand for red tourism has gradually increased.
However, the development of the red tourism industry also faces the difficulties of lacking young participants, homogenization of tourism projects, and single commercial channels.
In particular, the outbreak of COVID - 19 this year caused a serious setback in the national cultural and tourism industry, and red tourist attractions are also facing severe challenges.
For example, the use of UAV shooting, VR immersion, experience and other scientific and technological means can meet the tourist demand of "scenery in front of one ’s eyes"; the introduction of live-streaming to promote famous and high-quality products of red scenic spots can directly improve the economic benefits of red tourism; the introduction of "cloud" technology can create high-quality displays with prominent themes, clear guidance, and rich connotations that fully display and enhance the publicity and education functions of red scenic spots; there have been innovations in the transmission modes of red culture, making revolutionary cultural relics "come to life" and making red tourism popular, thereby passing down the red gene and enhancing the attraction of red scenic spots.
The popular model of "county (district) head + special promotion of professional live-streamers" to promote red cultural and tourism products in the cultural festival was used, and application of 5G technology provided real-time viewing, smart city demonstrations, and other services to promote red cultural and tourism attractions; together, all of these are efforts to increase the intelligence level of red tourism, and it is expected that red tourism in Hunan will become increasingly popular.
Sino-US trade Negotiators Scheduled to Meet in August
According to a report from Hong Kong ’s South China Morning Post on the 25th which cited an anonymous source, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who heads China's trade negotiation team, and US trade representative Lighthizer, who is co-leader of the US team, are expected to hold formal talks in August to review the implementation of the first phase of the bilateral trade agreement.
Although China has significantly increased its purchases of U.S. agricultural products over the past few months, it still falls short of the amounts pledged under the trade agreement because of factors such as COVID - 19 epidemic, the report said.
Analysts said that the recent closure of each other's consulates by the United States and China, together with other disputes, could undermine any progress in the trade between the two sides.
The first phase of the trade agreement, which took effect a month after it was signed on Jan 15, stipulates that high-level trade framework groups from both sides should hold talks every six months.
The meeting will be "an important turning point" for both sides to assess the progress of the agreement, according to an insider.
But the person added that if the tense relations between the United States and China lead to low willingness to hold talks at this time, the two sides may agree that the May 8 conference call between Lighthizer and Liu He meets the trade agreement's requirement to meet every six months.
Relations between China and the United States have deteriorated sharply this year, with disputes over the origin of COVID - 19, trade, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, the South China Sea, and ideology.
US President Donald Trump, who boasted about his achievements in the first phase of the deal at the start of the year, has recently changed his attitude.
Although China has been breaking the record for amounts of US corn and soybeans bought in a single day, "This trade deal doesn't mean as much to me now as it did when it was reached," he said at a White House press conference on 23th.
An anonymous Chinese government adviser also agreed that a new round of trade talks was unlikely because of the poor relations between the US and China and that "trade issues have lost weight in the Sino-US relationship."
However, he revealed that China's economic and trade agencies still held a meeting on the 23rd to discuss a series of issues, including how to increase imports from the United States, "We have tried our best to buy, so any additional purchases will be difficult."
Jacob Parker, vice president of the U.S. - China Business Council, said that it was "more important than ever" to maintain momentum on the first-phase agreement, and pointed out that China has made progress in further opening its financial market to US enterprises this year.
An analyst at the independent research company Plenum said that, "It's better to talk about it than not to talk about it, even though it may be treated as a routine matter. ”
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 26th, 2020 (Journalist: Wei Yukun) On July 26th, 2020, this journalist learned from the Ministry of Emergency Management that recently, the Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters and the Ministry of Emergency Management, together with the National Grain and Strategic Reserve Administration, made an emergency delivery of six kinds of centrally reserved materials to fight floods, including 1.35 million woven bags, woven cloth of 1.2 million square meters, and geotextiles of 130,000 square meters to Anhui Province in support of its emergency rescue efforts amidst a flooding disaster.
According to the relevant person in charge in the Ministry of Emergency Management, at present, in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the basin of the Huaihe River, the water level is high, the “No.3 Flood of Yangtze River in 2020 ” has formed in the upper reaches of Yangtze River on July 6th, and risks in some regions are increasing.
It is estimated by meteorological departments that in the next three days, there will be heavy downpours in Chongqing, Guizhou Province and in the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River, so the flood control situation is still severe and complex.
According to their introduction, this flooding season, the Ministry of Emergency Management has deployed national comprehensive fire control and rescue teams to important regions as a preemptive rescue measure, and have participated in 10,364 flood rescues, dispatched over 130,000 officers, 17,778 fire fighting trucks and 11,887 boats, rescued 37,777 people, and evacuated over 107,000 trapped people in danger.
NASDAQ Chief Representative for China Region: Now is the best time for US IPO ’s for Chinese companies - Economic Observer - Financial News Website
www.eeo.com.cn - Reporter - Zhang Bin - The US market has begun supervising China concept stocks more closely due to the Luckin Coffee fraud incident, and this, paired with long-term pressure on valuations, have increased the pressure faced by Chinese concept stocks in the American market, causing several companies such as NetEase and JD.com to begin the process of migrating their primary listing location to Hong Kong.
Meanwhile, companies such as Shell and Ideal Auto have recently expressed enthusiasm about listing in the US market.
Given the epidemic and the crisis for China concepts stocks, is now the best time for Chinese companies to hold IPO ’s in the US?
“Several recent examples of IPO ’s and the state of companies that plan to go public in the US soon show us that the basic nature of American IPO ’s have not changed, in fact the current market is very good, likely the best time in the past decade for Chinese companies to stage IPO ’s.“
These were the words of Hao Yusheng, NASDAQ Chief Representative for the China Region, at Xueqiu ’s “2020 Listed Company Leadership Summit China Concepts Stock Forum ”.
In April of this year, the American Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and Public Company Accounting Regulatory Board (PCAOB) stated, "Emerging Market Investments Entail Significant Disclosure, Financial Reporting and Other Risks; Remedies are Limited" listing certain risks that the disclosures by Chinese companies may be "incomplete or misleading."
According to the statement, despite the significant uptick in international cooperation in recent years, US regulators still have difficulty accessing information, and the SEC and PCAOB also face challenges on a legal and practical level; in addition to the statement, a detailed list of companies on the stock exchange which pose obstacles in their audits and their auditing agencies was posted on the PCAOB website, which included many Chinese concepts stock companies.
Beyond this, in May of this year, the US Senate passed the "Foreign Companies Accountability Act", which adds extra disclosure requirements for companies listed in the US.
Hao Yusheng believes the crisis for Chinese concepts stocks has not impacted the appetites of investors.
“Everyone panicked when the news first emerged, and wondered if they could list in the US in the future, but we soon discovered that this was not a problem for investors; investors will certainly encounter these new problems as they plan for their IPO ’s, and these may even become standardized requirements, but these are not important factors for investors when they decide whether to invest in Chinese companies.
Everyone should try to remain calm about the current situation.
This may seem to be the most serious development in the last two years, but in terms of investor appetite, it hasn’t had any impact.
So, from now to the end of the year, or until the US presidential election, the surge in US IPO ’s will continue. “
On May 9th, Kingsoft Cloud was officially listed on the NASDAQ in the US, making it the first Chinese company to stage its IPO in the US after the epidemic.
“The listing of Kingsoft Cloud should give Chinese companies getting ready for an IPO a lot of confidence,“
Hao Yusheng said.
Based on Xueqiu ’s 2020 China Stocks Data Report, in the first half of the year, 20 Chinese companies had IPO ’s in the US, a year-on - year increase of 17.6%; these 20 companies raised 2.725 billion yuan in initial funding, which was a rebound over last year, with a year-on - year increase of 52.4%; and industry distribution changed as well, with healthcare industry IPO ’s especially prominent in the first half of the year, showing a year-on - year increase of 100%.
Hao Yusheng said it was primarily high-quality Chinese companies that sought IPO ’s in the first half of the year, and that such high-quality companies with strong fundamentals and potential for growth are likely to become investor favorites.
Hao Yusheng continues to be optimistic about US IPO ’s for Chinese companies, whether in the short, medium, or long term.
“In the short term, the surge of companies holding IPO ’s in the US will continue; in the medium term, Chinese companies have more options with A-shares, Hong Kong stocks, and U.S. stocks, and factors such as the US election and China-US relations will be considerations for market and timing choices; in the long term, things should return to normal, with cyclical market fluctuations, both political and economic, ultimately returning to a normal state, because the markets have always fluctuated.“
At the same time, Hao Yusheng said, “There have been many factors of instability this year, but for the best companies, whatever market conditions may be, having a solid business and showing investors growth is more important than any other factors, so investors should choose high-quality Chinese companies.“

Commentator of the People's Daily: Focus on Running Our Own Affairs and Create New Advantages for the Future Development - - On Learning and Implementing General Secretary Xi Jinping's Important Speech at the Entrepreneur Forum - - XinhuaNet
Beijing, July 25 (Xinhua) - People's Daily, July 26, Article of Commentator: Focus on Running Our Own Affairs and Create New Advantages for the Future Development
At present, the global epidemic and the world economic situation are still serious and complex, and China faces unprecedented challenges in its development.
Maintaining strategic determination, strengthening our confidence to succeed, and concentrating on our own affairs are the keys for us to cope with all kinds of risks and challenges.
At the recent Entrepreneur Forum, General Secretary Xi Jinping stressed that in the face of an external environment characterized by rising protectionism, global economic downturn, and a shrinking international market, we need to pool resources and concentrate on managing the country's affairs well, and give full play to the advantage of a huge domestic market, so that a new pattern of development will gradually take shape, with domestic circulation playing a dominant role and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other, and as such, efforts should be made to elevate the modernization level of the industrial and supply chains, promote sci-tech innovation, speed up breakthroughs in core technologies, and foster new advantages for future development.
Those who observe the trends are wise, and those who follow the trends win.
In the external environment of the in-depth development of the economic globalization, putting both ends of market and resources on the world market have played an important role in China's rapid development.
At present, the world under the impact of COVID - 19 is undergoing profound changes, facing more unstable and uncertain factors, and economic globalization has encountered headwinds and undertows.
One of the most important aspects of making ideological and working preparations to cope with the changes in the external environment for a long time and promoting China's economy to ride the wind and waves and achieve steady development is to take expanding and meeting domestic demand as the strategic basis for development, give full play to its own advantages, and add impetus to China's economic development and drive the global economic recovery by allowing the domestic economy to prosper and unblocking domestic circulation.
We must be fully aware that building a complete system of domestic demand is vital to China's long-term development and stability.
The CPC Central Committee assessed the situation and made it clear that it was necessary to resolutely implement the strategy of expanding domestic demand in response to the impact of COVID - 19, thereby maintaining the long-term, sustained, and healthy development of China's economy, and consistently meeting people's increasing demand for a better life.
The advantage of a large economy is internal circulation.
China has the world ’s most complete and largest industrial system, strong production capacity, and complete supporting capabilities; it has more than 100 million market entities and more than 170 million talents with higher education or professional skills; besides, the huge domestic demand market formed by 1.4 billion people, including more than 400 million middle-income consumers, is in the fast development stage of new industrialization, informatization, urbanization and agricultural modernization, so the potential for investment demand is huge.
The basic economic systems, such as public ownership playing a leading role and all forms of ownership growing side by side, distribution according to labor as the main body with a variety of distribution methods coexisting, and the socialist market economy system can not only stimulate the vitality of all kinds of market entities and unleash and develop social productive forces, but also promote the organic integration of efficiency and equity, and constantly realize common prosperity.
We should firmly grasp the strategic focus of expanding domestic demand, make production, distribution and circulation more dependent on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, define the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and achieve dynamic balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand at a higher level.
We should speed up the construction of a complete system of domestic demand, vigorously promote innovation in science, technology and other fields, and accelerate the development of strategic emerging industries such as the digital economy, intelligent manufacturing, life and health, and new materials to form more new areas and poles of growth, so that a new development pattern will gradually emerge whereby domestic circulation plays a dominant role and domestic and international circulations reinforce each other.
Opening up brings progress, while isolation is bound to leave one behind.
General Secretary Xi Jinping has stressed on many occasions that China will not close its door and will only open wider to the outside world.
With the domestic market as the mainstay, we are by no means operating behind closed doors; rather, we will leverage the potential of domestic demand to better connect the domestic and international markets, and make better use of both domestic and international markets and resources to achieve stronger and more sustainable development.
Meanwhile, expanding domestic demand and opening up are not in conflict with each other, because the smoother the domestic circulation, the more conducive it will be to building a new pattern of opening up and creating new advantages for participating in international cooperation and competition.
Despite the rising trend of protectionism in the world, we must stay on the right side of history, deepen reform and opening-up, strengthen openness and cooperation in science and technology, promote an open world economy, and build a community with a shared future for mankind.
The Chinese nation has experienced many tribulations in its history, but it has never been overwhelmed; instead, its frustrations only give it the courage to grow stronger and rise up from its troubles.
On the way forward, China has the strong leadership of the Central Committee of the CPC, with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, has the remarkable advantage of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, has powerful mobilization capabilities and powerful overall strength, and has the unity and struggle of the whole party, the whole army and the people of all ethnic groups, meaning we can surely overcome all difficulties and obstacles, maintain the momentum of good economic and social development, build a well-off society in an all-round way, and successfully embark on a new journey to fully build a modern socialist country!
Yu'E Bao's Revenue Declines, but the "Post - 90s" Put Money into it in “Retaliation ”?
As Yu'E Bao's revenue declines, the "post - 90s" generation has not given up using Yu'E Bao, but has instead begun to put money into it like crazy.
The "Yu'E Bao Savings Report of the Post - 90s Generation" (2020 Edition) released by the China New Economic Research Institute with Alipay recently showed that in the first half of the year, the post - 90s generation was more interested in saving money: the amount of savings per capita increased by nearly 40% over 2019.
Interestingly, the post - 90s generation is more likely to start saving money with small sums, with 60% of them saving less than RMB 20 every time on average...
Putting money into Yu'E Bao has also become a habit of the post - 90s generation.
Statistics show that 134 million of the 700 million Yu'E Bao users were born in the 1990s.
China has 174 million people born in the 1990s, which means that about three out of every four of the post - 90s generation in the country are saving money with Yu'E Bao.
At present, the 7 - day annualized yield of Yu'E Bao and other monetary funds has fallen to about 1.5% from higher than 2% at the beginning of the year.
Even so, this has not affected the pace of the post - 90s generation saving money.
In the context of the increased "saving effect" of Yu'E Bao, many young people who are accustomed to Yu'E Bao have directly become "fund holders".
According to the data from Alipay, the number of new "fund holders" on Alipay has more than doubled in the past month as of July 13, with more and more young people achieving "advanced" financial management on Alipay.
Some analysts believe that funds flowing into the stock market from Yu'E Bao is also an important reason for the clear decline in the share of monetary funds in June.
The report also shows that post - 90s generation women are more likely to save more money than men, with the average amount of money saved by women being 20% higher than that of men, and among Alipay's fund holders, 60% are men, while women tend to choose more stable financial methods compared with men.
After saving their money, what are the plans of the post - 90s generation?
According to Alipay, the post - 90s generation has a habit of saving money for goals, and travel is the most popular goal for saving money.
Affected by the COVID - 19, many in the post - 90s generation have saved money to prepare for their post-epidemic travel; the resumption of cinema business also offers a new way to shift from saving to spending.

The bright Party flags flying high on the flood embankments are not only the embodiment of loyalty, but also the bugle sounded to charge.
In the face of flood disasters, organizations of the Party at all levels acted swiftly and sounded the "bugle to charge" to fight floods and planted bright Party flags on the flood-fighting embankments; Party members, cadres, and soldiers standing firmly on the flood-fighting battlefield have become the most reassuring, trustworthy, and solid barrier for people in the disaster area.
The bright Party flags flying high on the flood embankments represent selfless dedication and responsibility.
In times of crisis, it shows the true quality of the members of the Party; when the people ’s lives and property were seriously threatened, members and cadres of the Party and soldiers selflessly dedicated their efforts and dared to take responsibility; they considered the winning of the hard battle of flood prevention, flood fighting, emergency rescue and disaster relief as their main battlefield and parade ground to comprehensively test their ability, work style, and quality; their spirit of selfless dedication and responsibility inspired the confidence and determination of the people in disaster areas to overcome difficulties, and brought together a powerful spiritual force to win the fight for flood control, flood fighting, and disaster relief.
“Making people's life and safety the first priority ” is not only tested in peacetime, but also tested at critical moments.
On the anti-flood embankments, members and cadres of the Party and soldiers should let the people see the bright red Party flag, the figure of struggle, and the voice of encouragement everywhere and at all times, add luster to the Party flag with iron and steel dams that cannot be washed away by the floods, and make the bright Party flag fly high on the anti-flood embankments!

France Increases Its Military Spending in Space - - Xinhua Net
Florence Parly, Defense Minister of France, said on July 24 that France would invest further billions of euros into space defense to develop space military strength as a means to guard against other countries ’ possible “unfriendly behavior ” in the outer space.
Parly told La Provence that day that from 2019 to 2025, France ’s budget for space military projects would increase to EUR 4.3 billion (USD 5 billion) from the previous EUR 3.6 billion (about USD 4.2 billion).
According to the France Military Budget Plan 2019 - 2025, approved in 2018 by the French Assembly, France is projected to update its existing observation satellites and communication satellites and launch three electromagnetic interception satellites to enhance the modernization level of its space monitoring radar.
Emmanuel Macron, President of France, announced in July last year that the French air force would establish a space military command post and “aviation and space armies ” within itself.
Parly said that she would officially announce the establishment of the space army while inspecting a military college in Saron, Provence.
Parly said that the space army fell under the air force and by 2025, its authorized strength would reach 500.
She said “People previously perceived space as a place to serve for the common interests of science, but they don’t think that anymore. Space is a place where all major powers compete for global hegemony. ”
Parly reiterated Macron ’s previous announcement, saying that France was not interested in arms race.
“We are not starting an arms race at all. But I am responsible for thoroughly acknowledging the possible threats we face. ”
Parly re-stated that the military satellite jointly used by France and Italy was spied on in 2017.
She said that the “secret watcher ” was a Russian satellite.
Russia denied this.
Parly said that France would “soon ” have small patrol satellites able to detect and identify the“ bad actors behind unfriendly behavior ”.
French media holds the view that France ’s efforts to establish its space military was caused by Donald Trump ’s requirement for U.S. Department of Defense to draft bills to build a space force in February of last year.
Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Bill in December last year, approving the establishment of the sixth armed services branch in the United States, the Space Force.
Some experts feared that the measures taken by the United States would accelerate the militarization of its space endeavors, which might arouse a new arms race in space.

Report states shared accommodation market has started to recover since March chinanews.com
This news agency has reported (correspondent Yang Zhoukui) that, according to the “State of Shared Accommodation in China Report 2020 ” (abbreviated as“ Report ”) released by the State Information Center of China Sharing Economy Research Institute, thanks to the impact of the epidemic, the in the first 5 months of 2020, the number of transactions in China ’s shared accommodation market declined by 72.1% year-on - year.
However, the shared accommodation market has started to recover since March, with the number of transactions, order volume, and number of guest stays gradually increasing.
The Report states that the sharp reduction in shared accommodation market transactions is caused, in part, by the sharp reduction in demand for travel accommodations due to epidemic control measures, which has drastically reduced order volume over the past 5 months; order volume is down by 65% year-on - year and guest stays are down by 65% year-on - year; meanwhile, it is also caused in part by a notable drop in per-night room prices due to decreased demand, which have declined an average of 16% year-on - year over the past 5 months.
However, in March, April, and May, the number of market transactions increased by 78%, 199%, and 35%, respectively; order volume increased by 141%, 152%, and 50%, respectively; and the number of guest stays increased by 81%, 112%, and 28%, respectively.
The Report points out that the shared accommodation market is promising in the long-term, but faces many uncertainties in the near term.
In response, Yu Fengxia, assistant director of the State Information Center of China Sharing Economy Research Institute, told a Workers ’ Daily reporter that the shared accommodation market requires better policy support: on one hand, better implementation of previously issued policies and improved policy announcement channels to create a better business environment; as well as increased policy guidance and support through further stimulation of consumer demand, improved supply of tourism and accommodation services, innovative service models, improved government-to - platform / enterprise cooperation, and in many other aspects.

XIAMEN, July 26 (Ecns.cn, by Yang Fushan, Zhang Shushan, Xu Jingyi) Vascular Surgery Department in Changhai Hospital in Shanghai affiliated to the Second Military Medical University, as a famous vascular surgery center in China, signed a contract with the Vascular Surgery Department of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University on July 25 to set up a cooperation center, which will promote exchanges and cooperation in the field of vascular surgery, especially in aortic emergencies and severe cases.
Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University said that after the vascular surgery department of the two hospitals formally establish the collaborative relationship, they will carry out remote consultation to work out real-time treatment plans with Changhai Hospital, staff will be sent for training and participating in weekly surgical technology exchanges and teaching visits organized by two hospitals; for complex cases, Changhai experts can be invited to perform surgery at the hospital according to patients' needs, allowing patients in southwest Fujian to enjoy the top medical resources in China without leaving the province.
The two hospitals will also work together to carry out innovative scientific research on surgery, popularization of aortic disease, early screening, and so on.
A special seminar on the aorta, organized by the Beijing Health Promotion Association and hosted by the Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, was held in Xiamen on the same day.
The two famous hospitals in Shanghai and Xiamen held a signing ceremony for the cooperation center for vascular surgery at the same time, announcing the formation of the collaborative partnership to jointly improve the treatment of vascular surgery-related diseases in southwest Fujian.
The Vascular Surgery Department in Changhai Hospital of Shanghai is the only vascular surgery institute in the army and the only clinical medical center for vascular diseases in Shanghai, so as the first national key institute in the discipline of vascular surgery, the hospital has taken the lead in setting up the Chinese Medical Doctor Association's Specialist Committee on Endovascology, which is a leading and experienced team in this field.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of the Vascular Surgery Department in Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University, was interviewed by the media.
The Vascular Surgery Department in Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is the first vascular surgery department set up as an independent discipline in Fujian Province; it has long been dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of aortic and peripheral vascular diseases, and was approved as a provincial clinical key specialty in 2018.
In the treatment of aortic diseases, the hospital has vast experience in not only treating dissecting aneurysms and aortic aneurysms, but also the rupture of aortic aneurysms.
"Viewed from the diversity, difficulty, complication and other aspects of surgery, the vascular surgery department of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University is outstanding in the region where it is located, which is why this cooperation center has been created to carry out all-round and in-depth cooperation in medicine, teaching and research in the diagnosis and treatment of lower extremity arteries, carotid arteries and other diseases not limited to the aorta, ”
said Professor Feng Rui, Deputy Director of Vascular Surgery Department at Changhai Hospital.
In 2018, the Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Xiamen University and Changhai Hospital signed a contract to establish the "Li Zhaoshen Famous Doctor Studio" in the Gastroenterology Department.
Professor Huang Xiaojin, Director of Vascular Surgery Department, said in an interview with Ecns.cn that the hospital's vascular surgery department already has a long-term relationship with Changhai Hospital, and the formal collaborative relationship between the two hospitals can bring their cooperation and exchange to a deeper level.
He said that the hospital would regularly invite Shanghai experts to Xiamen to carry out surgical exchanges, teaching ward rounds, and discussions on difficult cases, weekly remote consultations are planned, and the department will also send staff for further training and exchanges to strengthen team cultivation and development.
The reporter learned at the seminar that vascular disease is the number one cause of death in China, and the aorta plays an important role as the main artery for all organs and the heart.
Aortic disease is often associated with high risks, high mortality, and complicated treatment; the thickest section of the aorta is 4cm in diameter, and once an aneurysm appears, followed by a rupture or intima rupture and dissecting aneurysm, it can lead to hemorrhage, which is very dangerous.
In recent years, as people's lifestyles change and the pace of life speeds up, China has become the leading country around the world for hypertension, and aortic disease cases has increased, so along with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic disease continues to be minimally invasive, rapid, and efficient.
Doctors can "reroute" the blood flow by puncturing the thigh and placing a stent in the aorta to avoid impact on the aneurysm or ruptured dissection and to achieve good results, and some cases can even be done with local anesthesia.
More than ten domestic experts were invited to the seminar to discuss new advances in the treatment of aortic disease, with cutting-edge technology training and discussion of difficult cases in the form of salons.
This reporter learned at the seminar that along with the development of surgical techniques and industrial materials, the treatment of aortic disease continues to be minimally invasive, rapid, and efficient.
Ministry of Emergency Management maintains L2 flood control measures for Yangtze and Huaihe Rivers - Xinhuanet
Heavy rainfall is expected from the Sichuan Basin to the middle and lower Yangtze River regions
Ministry of Emergency Management maintains L2 flood control measures for Yangtze and Huaihe Rivers
This reporter learned from the Emergency Management Department on the 25th that heavy rains are predicted until the 27th for areas from the Sichuan Basin to the middle and lower Yangtze River regions, so continued attention must be paid to their affect on Yangtze River and Huaihe River flood conditions, because both rivers pose a high risk of hazards such as landslides, collapses, and piping.
In response, the Ministry of Emergency Management has decided to maintain its L2 flood control measures for the Yangtze and Huaihe Rivers.
On the 25th, the Ministry of Water Resources pointed out that water levels remain high along the middle and lower Yangtze River, the Huaihe River ’s flood peaks pass through the Bengbu section of Anhui, and on Lake Tai, the water level has been over warning levels for 28 days and over protection levels for 9 days, meaning that there is an extremely high risk of flooding, flood control work cannot be relaxed, and every aspect of flood defense must be done well.
Prevention work must also be carried out in the Southwest and North China regions where heavy rains are expected.
The Ministry of Water Resources has decided to maintain the L2 emergency flood and drought prevention measures.
At the request of the Jiangxi province and national flood and drought prevention and control departments and the Ministry of Emergency Management, 20 high-volume flood drainage vehicles were dispatched by firefighting and rescue corps in Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang and the Fujian Longyan Qiaolong Emergency Equipment Company to help alleviate serious disasters in Jiangxi such as urban waterlogging and farmland flooding that result from such heavy rains.
On the 25th, all such heavy equipment arrived at the front lines of flood control and relief operations in Jiangxi.
As stipulated by the unified directive from local governments, the Ministry of Emergency Management Firefighting and Rescue Bureau Jiangxi Flooding Relief Front Line Command immediately ordered the Jiangxi Firefighting and Rescue Corps and assistance teams from neighboring provinces to establish 20 flood drainage teams for emergency flood drainage tasks in Nanchang, Jiujiang, and Shangrao in Jiangxi.
At the same time, the National Flood and Drought Prevention and Control Department and Ministry of Emergency Management made an emergency deployment from national reserves of 100 trailer pumps for flood control to support the flood relief and drainage work in Jiangxi.
At noon on July 25th, the Anhui Province Flood and Drought Prevention and Control Headquarters announced that emergency flooding measures would be in force for the relevant areas of the Yangtze River, Huaihe River, and Chaohu Basin in Anhui.

Chinanews.com, Chongqing, posted July 26th (correspondent Han Lu) On July 26th, this reporter learned from China Railway Chengdu Bureau Group LTD that the Zhengzhou – Wanzhou high-speed railway ’s Small Three Gorges Tunnel, with a total length of roughly 18.9 km, had been completed the same day.
Based on available information, the Small Three Gorges Tunnel is both the longest high-speed rail tunnel in the Three Gorges Reservoir area, and also, among the rail projects under construction in China, is the longest dual-track single-hole high-speed rail tunnel with a 350 km / h design speed.
The Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway links cities within the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Chongqing, connects to the Beijing-Guangzhou and Xuzhou-Lanzhou high-speed rail routes via the Zhengzhou North Station and reaches Chongqing through the Chongqing-Wanzhou intercity railway link via the Wanzhou South Station; it is an important component of China ’s "Eight Vertical and Eight Horizontal" network that connects to the Yangtze River corridor and the Hohhot – Nanning corridor.
The Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway Small Three Gorges Tunnel was fully connected on the 26th.
Image of fully opened tunnel.
The Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway begins in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, then runs southwest through Pingdingshan City, Nanyang City, and Xiangyang City in Hubei Province, and terminates in Wanzhou District, Chongqing City; the length of the new line is about 818 km, of which 184 km run through the borders of Chongqing, and has a design speed of 350 km / h.
The Zhengzhou-Xiangyang stage of the line opened early on December 1st, 2019, and construction on the Chongqing stage is being accelerated.
The Small Three Gorges Tunnel, which was fully connected on the 26th, is a total-line control project for the Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway; the project is located at the border of Fengjie County and Wushan County, Chongqing City, has a total length of roughly 18.9 km, and has a maximum buried depth of 890 meters.
Work began on the tunnel in February of 2017, and the tunnel was fully connected on July 26th, 2020.
Wang Guojun, director of tunnel design for the Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway at China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group Co., Ltd., stated that the Small Three Gorges Tunnel cuts through highly complicated terrain and geological conditions, and faces risks such as karsts, sudden mudslides, and massive soft rock deformation, making it a Class I high-risk tunnel, for which design and construction are exceedingly difficult.
“During construction, we used approaches such as geological surveys, geophysical techniques, and advanced drilling methods to make geological forecasts far in advance and create special design plans for over 30 types of caves. For example, we built a bridge within the tunnel that was 24 meters in length across a karst cave gap that was 10 meters wide and 55 meters deep to avoid tunnel settlement, ” he said.
The building company, the China Railway Tunnel Group, constructed the tunnel using a combination of dredging and blocking, building horizontal tunnels, water blocking, enhanced structural tunnel support, and building outflow treatment plants, which together ensured the project could proceed on schedule while avoiding damage from polluted wastewater to the Three Gorges Scenic Area, and at the same time, overcame construction problems such as 7 kilometers of karst soft rock deformation and other bad geology, as well as a maximum daily water inflow of 157,000 cubic meters.
When the Zhengzhou-Wanzhou high-speed railway is completed and fully operational, it will have critical importance as a rapid and convenient passenger channel that connects the regions of Southwest China, the Central Plains, North China, and Northeast China which improves both the quality and capacity of the Southwest China railway network ’s northeast corridor, improves the regional transit network, speeds up the development of tourism resources and urbanization along the route, promotes inter-regional coordinated development, and facilitates the implementation of the Western Region development strategy.
Collecting immigration status data through US Census for House of Representatives seat allocation is unconstitutional, say experts
Civil rights groups and several US cities and counties have filed a lawsuit against the US federal government, claiming the Trump administration ’s attempts to exclude undocumented immigrants from the US Census are both unconstitutional and would unworkable.
The US Census decides the allocation of seats in the US House of Representatives.
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) executive director Sarah Brannon told VOA, “This is unworkable.“
She continued, saying Trump ’s demand that the US Census determine the immigration status of census respondents was difficult and “not very reliable ”.“
Common Cause, another civil rights organization, filed a lawsuit on Thursday to challenge Trump ’s executive order.
Several New Jersey and Georgia cities joined the lawsuit.
On Friday, Virginia ’s Arlington County also joined the lawsuit.
Arlington County Board Chair Libby Garvey said, “The US Constitution requires that we make an accurate count of our population every 10 years. We need an accurate count of every resident in Arlington County, and we must never illegal attempts like these to frighten away and shrink our immigrant community succeed.“
Other individuals and organizations expressed praise for Trump ’s executive order.
Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall called the executive order a “victory ” for the state.
He said, “The allocation of House of Representatives and electoral college seats must be based on the number of residents in each state, particularly the number of legal residents.“
Last year, the US Supreme Court stopped the Trump administration ’s attempts to include citizenship questions on the 2020 census form.
Earlier this week President Trump signed an executive order directing Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, who oversees the US Census Bureau, to submit data on the undocumented population obtained from the census, so that the administration can exclude this population from state census results, which in turn are used to determine whether each state will increase, decrease, or maintain its number of seats in the House of Representatives.
Seats in the US House of Representatives are reallocated every 10 years based on changes in population.
Heavy rainfall in 33 Chonging districts and counties, local Level IV flood control emergency measures initiated - chinanews.com
Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, reported July 26th (correspondents: Ke Gaoyang, Li Song) Our reporters have learned from Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters that during a new round of heavy rains in Chongqing on July 25th, 33 districts and counties experienced heavy rainstorms, and water levels in 4 small and medium-size rivers rose above flood alert levels, causing local Level IV flood control emergency measures to be initiated.
According to reports from the Chongqing Municipal Hydrological Monitoring Station, between 8: 00 on the 25th to 8: 00 on the 26th, most areas of Chongqing experienced heavy rain, with heavy rainstorms appearing in 33 districts and counties including Jiangjin, Qijiang, and Wulong, and very heavy rainstorms appearing across 16 districts and counties including Wanzhou, Yunyang, and Nanchuan.
The highest daily rainfall of 197.5 mm occurred in Longshan Village, Jinshan Town, Nanchuan.
The heavy rain caused four small and medium-sized rivers; Lvzi River in Jiangjin District, Youjiang River in Fuling District, Yingyang River in Kaizhou District, and Tuantan River in Yunyang County; saw waters rise above flood alert levels, and at present, water levels are still rising.
The rain also led to landslides in Liujing Village, Didi Township, and Wulong District, which blocked traffic on village roads, and caused blockage of the Cang River along the Wujiang River, resulting in the river water forming a temporary lake, at which point an emergency evacuation was organized for local residents.
The Chongqing Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters responded to this torrential rain by issuing a Level III emergency river flood warning at 13: 00 on the 26th and initiating Level IV flood control emergency measures, as well as instructing the affected counties and regions to conduct more frequent inspections and be on high alert, in case emergency rescue teams and materials needed to be urgently mobilized and people in affected areas required evacuation.
Acting in response to trends and advancing the construction of industrial projects-Shidian Net-Hunan Daily-www.voc.com.cn
Hunan in midsummer is steaming hot.
The enthusiasm unleased by the on-the - spot observation meeting for promoting the construction of industrial projects in the whole province surpassed even the heat summer heat, and the distinct guidance of "comparing strength with industry and defining heroes with projects" inspired industry in Hunan.
The development of Hunan should rely on constructing projects and fostering industries.
Faced with the unusual first half of the year, under the firm leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, the whole province united as one and made every effort to fight the tough battles against COVID - 19 pandemic prevention and flood control, and adopted industrial projects as the "pioneer" in the implementation of "ensuring stability in employment, financial operations, foreign trade, foreign investment, domestic investment, and expectations" and "ensuring security in job, basic living needs, operations of market entities, food and energy security, stable industrial and supply chains, and the normal functioning of primary-level governments".
From a year-on - year decline of 1.9% in the first quarter to a year-on - year growth of 1.3% in the first half of the year, it is hard to imagine how many difficulties we have overcome and how much effort we have expended during this period.
In this precious report, the construction of industrial projects is the key support for Hunan to speed up the recovery of the economy and stable development.
The trend is irreversible.
The construction of industrial projects should be put into the overall situation, and not only should we be good at accumulating and seeking potential, but also we should be good at recognizing, seeking, and acting according to changes.
Under the complex and severe background of the current international situation, in addition to painstaking efforts to attract investment, we need to concentrate on researching the new characteristics of the current new situation, grasp the rules more scientifically and be more scientific and accurate, and better integrate into the new development paradigm featuring dual circulation, in which domestic and overseas markets reinforce each other, with the domestic market as the mainstay.
We have paid more attention to improving the basic capabilities of industry.
In the first half of the year, not only did a large number of heavyweight investment projects in emerging industries start and sow hopes in our province, but also enterprises in traditional industries have accelerated their deployment in digital, intelligent, and green industrial transformation.
Transformations have been made in the existing production line of the project of Yiyang Aoshikang No.3 Science Park, and the intelligent production line of high-end printed circuit board has taken the lead; the new factory of the Changde Cigarette Factory of China Tobacco Hunan Industrial Corporation was committed to the process of intelligent transformation and the construction of modern factories, which was also a vivid portrayal of "old trees sprouting new buds"; focusing on the national major strategy and "new infrastructure and new urbanization initiatives and major projects", we have focused on consolidating and upgrading advantageous industries, actively cultivated and developed emerging industries, and comprehensively increased the strength of scientific and technological innovation and localization substitution to continuously consolidate basic conditions and accumulate transformation momentum.
We have paid more attention to cultivating and developing new industries, new business forms, and new models.
The unexpected COVID - 19 outbreak brought about the popularity of the "cloud economy", stimulated the potential of the digital economy, and provided new opportunities for industrial transformation; in the first half of the year, the computer and office equipment manufacturing, electronic and communication equipment manufacturing industry of our province grew by 12.6%, and the online retail sales of wholesale and retail enterprises above a designated size increased by 32.2% over the same period last year, and the income of online meals from catering enterprises increased by 35.6% over the same period last year.
We have created new opportunities out of crises and opened up new prospects in changing circumstances; we have actively promoted digital industrialization and industrial digitization, and guided the integrated development of the digital economy and real economy.
We have paid more attention to optimizing and stabilizing the industrial chain and the supply chain.
Construction machinery is the main force of industry in Hunan, but two thirds of the supporting enterprises are outside the province, so there is still space and potential in the supporting chain.
To strengthen industrial chain thinking and better grasp the project, we need to continuously accumulate experience from leading enterprises and achieve technological breakthroughs in the key links of the industrial chain; we should also cultivate all localities with great concentration, stimulate the "chain" reaction by strengthening the chain, supplementing the chain, and extending the chain, promote the collaborative layout of relevant supporting industries, and speed up the construction of an independent, controllable, safe, and reliable industrial chain and supply chain.
We are overcoming hardship together and supporting our enterprises; Hunan is still a land of enthusiasm and happiness with a good business environment and emerging business opportunities.
All parts of the province have frequently employed new and practical methods, believing that the "burden reduction" of enterprises promotes the "acceleration" of high-quality development; "shareholder type" services have been implemented in Shaoyang to guarantee the high efficiency of enterprises; in the process of recovering the losses caused by the epidemic, there were many vivid stories about finding weak links and pain points, and turning risks into opportunities.
Focusing on the research, cultivation, and development of industries, and solidly optimizing the business environment will surely win the favor of more investors.
Difficulties ahead remain, but the state of overcoming difficulties has become the normal state for the whole province to focus on the construction of industrial projects and promote high-quality development.
During this critical period, we must learn and carry out the important instructions and spirit of general secretary Xi Jinping, and respond to external uncertainties effectively with the certainty of our work; we must persevere in promoting industrial projects and uniting as one with enthusiasm to ensure that the "13th Five-Year Plan" and the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects will be accomplished successfully.

Overall Stable Employment and Price Indicate “Temperature ” of Economy
Reported by Economic Daily · ce.cn correspondent Lin Huocan
Facing the impact of COVID - 19 in the first half of this year, China carried forward pandemic prevention and control as well as economic and social development in a coordinated manner; pandemic prevention and control continues to improve, while the economy is obviously recovering, and with employment and commodity prices, which are closely related to people ’s well-being, in a generally stable state, China ’s economy is presenting an economic performance card with “normal temperature ”.
In the first two months of this year, the surveyed unemployment rate increased.
Especially in February, the production and operation of many companies were basically shutdown, and with demand for labor decreased and recruitment postponed or cancelled, the urban unemployment rate increased as a result.
As the outbreak prevention and control outcomes took a turn for the better, the order of production and living standards across the society is recovering.
The Party Central Committee adheres to the key idea of seeking improvements in stability to further enhance the hedging strength of macro policies, reinforce pro-employment policies in all dimensions, and to actively facilitate efforts in assisting companies to maintain staffing stability and expand employment.
China is reinforcing policies to offset the impact and maintain employment with a portfolio of “reduce, exempt, defer, return and subsidy ” policies: reducing and exempting 3 types of social insurance for companies in a phased manner, allowing deferred payments of social insurance fees, increasing beneficiary ranges for returning unemployment insurance to medium, small, and micro enterprises to maintain work posts and for work-based training policies, and providing subsidies for companies employing key population groups.
As employment stabilization policies were implemented, companies demands for labor gradually recovered, and as employment improves, the urban unemployment rate has decreases; in June, the unemployment rate was 5.7%.
According to Zhang Yi, Director of the Population and Employment Statistics Division of National Bureau of Statistics, all employment policies continued to be effective in the second quarter; labor that retreated earlier due to the outbreak is returning gradually, and in June, the urban labor participation rate increased around 10 points compared to February, close to that of the same period last year.
As data shows, the total urban employment in June increased 19% compared to February, with many industries bouncing back to pre-pandemic levels; average weekly working hours of company employees reached 46.8 hours, 6.6 hours higher than in February, and 0.1 hours higher than in January.
Commodity prices are also relevant for families.
In January, CPI increased 5.4% year on year, a record high in many years.
In February, year-on - year CPI dropped slighted, but was still above 5%.
High level year-on - year CPI growth was driven by consumer demand before Spring Festival, but even with Spring Festival demand, it fell by month and was lower on a year-on - year base.
However, COVID - 19 had an obvious impact on commodity prices.
Affected by pandemic prevention and control, delays in logistics and supplies, increases in transportation costs occurred across the country in January and February; also, as some people rushed to hoard, the prices of some daily necessities went up.
In response to disturbances in commodity prices from pandemic prevention and control, the relevant authorities put major daily supplies in emergency circulation to ensure unblocked supply.
Through a series of policies and measures, the market supply of vegetables and fruit was secured.
In response to the sharp rise in pork price at the beginning of the year, the central government rolled out policies to maintain prices and supply, and regions and departments swiftly implemented them accordingly; as a result, the pork reserve supply obviously improved, capacity in pigs for slaughter was restored in an orderly manner, and order in production and sales gradually returned to normal.
Since March, pork prices have been dropping continuously, leading food prices to fall back to a 10.6% year-on - year increase in May; in June, affected by slowed output of pigs for slaughter, reduced imports, and recovered group consumption, pork prices saw slight month-on - month growth.
Seasonal changes in fresh vegetable prices were clear, with an average of 3.4% growth in the first half.
Due to a high year-on - year starting point last year, fresh fruit saw continuous drop in year-on - year prices, with an average 13.3% drop in the first half.
With people ’s essential everyday needs effectively secured, the overall economic and social order was kept stable.
As transportation and logistics gradually returned to normal, regions reinforced supply guarantee measures, and market demand and supply took a turn for the better.
Since March, month-on - month CPI dropped for 4 consecutive months, year-on - year growth fell back to 2.5% in June from 4.3% in March, and overall commodity prices have stabilized.
In the next half of the year, commodity prices in the country will continue to maintain at a moderate level, with no significant inflation pressure overall, however, we still need to facilitate restoring the order of production and living with the premise of regular outbreak prevention and control.
Natural disasters like flood and drought in major agricultural production regions of crops, vegetables, and fruit must be dealt with efficiently, market supervision and regulation must be reinforced to sternly crack down regrading and price-gouging behaviors that disturb market order.

chinanews.com, South Qinghai Lake, reported July 26th, headline: Qinghai Lake “Sea of Flowers Livecast Studio ”:“ Sweetness “increases farmer income
Writers: Hu Guilong, Pan Yujie
“At Qinghai Lake in midsummer, there are golden flowers as far as the eye can see, and innumerable bees flying everywhere; the high elevation is high, large temperature difference between night and day, low air pollution, and strong illumination breeds the most resilient and fertile bee colonies which create the highly active, protein-rich, and nutritious Qinghai royal jelly, which is also low in sugar and fat,“
said Zhang Jianxun, assistant director of the Industry and Information Administration of Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province.
The same day, the “Fighting the Epidemic Together Spring Royal Jelly Farmer Assistance ” livecast sales event was held at Qinghai Lake, at which company representatives from the Chinese Bee Products Association, beekeepers, and many others came together to promote Qinghai ’s bee products, selling nearly 10,000 bottles of Qinghai Plateau royal jelly for a value of almost 3.8 million yuan.

According to reports, this livecast sales event helped the Beijing Houdeli Bee Products, Kuaishou, Taobao, and other well-known chain store networks, live broadcast platforms, and e-commerce platforms promote “enterprise + apiary + grower ” exchange and cooperation, connect online and offline channels, and continue to issue“ Qinghai Plateau Spring Jelly Consumption Vouchers ” to consumers, helping these customers earn an estimated total annual profit of nearly 5.28 million yuan.
Wu Na, CEO of Beijing Houdeli Bee Products, said the event was “very worthwhile ”:“ This event helps grow the popularity of Qinghai bee products, helps more consumers to learn about and appreciate pure, natural bee products without additives, and drives beekeeper income growth. ” “
Currently, the company has signed strategic production cooperation agreements with Qinghai Cloud Honey LTD and Qinghai Huabao Bee Industry Holdings LTD, and they will work together to promote the rapid development of Qinghai ’s bee products industry.

This spring, due to roadblocks set up to control the epidemic, beekeepers have been blocked from their usual “following the flowers to produce honey ” routes, many bees have died of starvation because they missed the flowering periods, and beekeeper incomes have suffered a sharp decline.
Throughout the year, beekeepers typically travel long distances to follow the flowering periods, from Yunnan and Sichuan all the way to the northwest, they are exposed to the weather and have no fixed residence, and it ’s very difficult work.
We have a responsibility as entrepreneurs to help them, “
said Wu Na.
“Bees are ‘ nature ’s advance scouts’, because they can’t survive in heavily polluted areas.“ Zhao Xiaochuan, deputy secretary of the China Bee Products Association, explained that pollination by bees is a very important link in the ecological chain, and that it plays an irreplaceable role in protecting plant diversity and improving the environment.
Bee pollination also increases the yield and quality of crops, and is even more important in regions with a wide diversity of crops and poor farm management.
Research data proves that pollination improves rapeseed yields by 15 - 30%.

“The economic, environmental, and social benefits of bee pollination go far beyond the mere value of the bee products, and the apiary industry has enormous potential in the areas of human health, plant reproduction, and environmental protection, but there has never been wide awareness of this fact,“
said Zhao Xiaochuan.
The number of beekeepers is declining, but in addition to the traveling industry professionals, there are also many poor households with limited mobility who practice beekeepers as part of cooperatives.
“The country offers financial support, and we ’ve contacted technology experts for help and guidance, but beekeepers lack understanding and discernment of the market environment, so opening new markets requires help and coordination from government, enterprises, and industry associations,“
said Zhao Xiaochuan.
“I hope people will pay more attention to beekeepers and offer them support in the future, ” said Wu Na.“ And as we strive to help beekeepers, we strictly adhere to national standards in the selection and control of our bee products to ensure quality and protect the rights of consumers. ” “

The Possibility of Victory is adapted from historical facts, and is based on Soviet Union military archive materials which have been classified for many years.
During the Fight for Moscow, the elite Far Eastern army of the Soviet Red Army went west to assist in the fight, but at that time the “Going North Faction ” of Japan ’s Kwantung Army held the view that there would be opportunities in the north, so troops should be sent.

Su Qing has attempted to play different roles in recent years, from Lu Ruowen in We Were Young in Those Years to Erqing in Story of Yanxi Palace, all of which left a deep impression upon the general public, and her skill is now widely recognized.
This is the first collaboration between Su Qing and Liu Yunlong, a stuttering policeman an an enchanting policewoman, and is both eye-catching and novel.

Greenland Launches a New Round of Mixed Reform, and Shanghai State-owned Assets Transfers 17.5% of Its Shares - www.eeo.com.cn - Professional Financial News Website
Eeo.com.cn reporter Rao Xianjun, July 26, Greenland Holdings (600606.SH) issued a "Suggestive Announcement on the State-owned Shareholders' Intention to Transfer Part of the Company's Shares and Resume Trading through Public Solicitation of the Transferee."
According to the announcement, in order to further deepen the reform of state-owned assets and state-owned enterprises, optimize the structural adjustment of state-owned assets, and improve the ownership structure of Greenland, Shanghai Land (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Land") and Shanghai Chengtou Investment (Group) Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanghai Chengtou Investment") plan to transfer part of the shares of the company held by the transferee through public solicitation, and the total proportion of the shares to be transferred shall not exceed 17.5% of the total share capital of Greenland.
The price of the shares to be transferred this time shall not be lower than the higher of the following two: the arithmetic average of the daily weighted average price of the 30 trading days before the suggestive announcement date (July 27, 2020); the audited net asset value per share of the company in the latest accounting year.
At present, there is still no final conclusion on the new strategic investors of Greenland, but according to the information estimates in the announcement, the new strategic investors need to pay about RMB 14 billion to take the 17.5% equity transferred in the mixed-use reform of Greenland.
It is worth noting that after the completion of the share transfer, Greenland is expected to have no controlling shareholders and actual controllers, but the control structure may change greatly.
Since its establishment, Greenland Holdings has carried out many institutional reforms: from 1992 to 1997, it was operated under the pure state-owned system in accordance with market-oriented rules; from 1997 to 2013, it established and continuously improved the joint-stock system of state-owned holding and employee shareholding; from 2013 to 2015, strategic investors were introduced to form a mixed ownership system of cross-shareholding and mutual integration of state-owned and non-public capital; and since 2015, the company has been entirely listed and has become a public company.
Greenland's current mixed reform plan is similar to Gree's: in December 2019, Zhuhai Mingjun, led by Hillhouse Capital, took over 15% of the shares of Gree Electric Appliances (000651.SZ) with RMB 41.662 billion, and the Gree Group retreated to being the minority shareholder; after the completion of the mixed reform, Gree implemented modern enterprise management methods, such as executive incentive plans and no real controller structure.
Shanghai Land and Shanghai Chengtou Investment are all state-owned enterprise groups wholly owned by Shanghai SASAC, and Zhang Yuliang, chairman and president of Greenland holdings, said that Greenland's move is an important measure for Shanghai to promote the comprehensive reform of state-owned assets and enterprises and accelerate the reform of state-owned assets and enterprises in the new era in accordance with the requirements of the CPC Central Committee; it also fully shows the new concept of reform that adapts measures to local conditions and acts according to actual circumstances, because it is necessary to introduce new shareholders to support the reform of corporate strategy, further improve the degree of corporate management freedom, and accelerate the full release of reform vitality.
Inter-province travel resumes, nation ’s first high-speed train tour launches - Xinhuanet
Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, reported July 25th (Correspondent: Li Ping) On July 25th, over 200 tourists from Shanghai on the D771 train arrived in Lanxi, Zhejiang Province, making this the first group tour to take an inter-provincial train since the Ministry of Culture and Tourism resumed inter-province (region, city) group tours on July 14th.
Located in central and western Jiangxi, Lanxi City boasts beautiful scenery and many scenic spots such as Zhuge Bagua Village, the Dixia Changhe Scenic Area, and Zhiyan Village, all of which are to be visited by the more than 200 tourists in the tour group on their 2 - day 1 - night trip.
Li Li, assistant general manager of Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) LTD, said that based on the latest policies, the company closely monitors demand for inter-province travel, communicates closely with Lanxi, and launched the “Shanghai to Lanxi ” and“ Summer Lotus-Viewing Two-Day Tour ” products, the latter of which sold out less than a week after launching.
Mrs. Sun, from Shanghai, said she hadn’t left her house this year because of the pandemic.
“I ’ve been bored sitting at home for a long time, so when I saw a group tour, I shared the news with my friends right away, and we all signed up, and I ’ve never visited Lanxi, so I ’ve been looking forward to this trip,“ said Mrs. Sun.
Sources state that in September of last year, Lanxi and Shanghai Railway International Tourism (Group) LTD signed the “Ride the High-Speed Rail to Lanxi ” strategic cooperation agreement, which aims to operate 12 dedicated high-speed tourism trains from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Anhui to Lanxi within the year.

White House Adviser “Counterattacks ” States ’ Premature Reopening-ChinaNews.com
White House Adviser “Counterattacks ” States ’ Premature Reopening
As of July 23 local time, the number of confirmed COVID - 19 cases in the United States topped 4 million, accounting for 30% of global cases.
For months, U.S. President Trump has repeatedly asked for states to reopen businesses and schools, and only recently changed his attitude and started wearing masks in public, while his advisers accuse some state governments of reopening businesses too early.
On 22nd, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said at a press conference that some states didn’t follow reopening standards and opened businesses like bars too early.
Conway also mentioned that statements regarding the President having “absolute power ” in deciding states reopening matters are misinformed rumors.
“The President is a federalist who believes in the autonomous rights of states."
she said in Trump ’s defense.
However, this so-called “rumor ” was stated by Trump himself at the White House outbreak briefing on April 13.
This flip-flop was mocked on the internet as “rewriting history ”.
Attempting to rewrite history makes Kellyanne Conway a liar.
Trump called Gretchen Whitmer, governor of Michigan, a dictator because she followed medical guidelines and insisted on lockdown.
Trump wanted to facilitate reopening so that he could hold rallies.
This isn’t the first time Kellyanne Conway has caused controversy.
On April 15, when interviewed by Fox News, Conway blurted out, “This is COVID - 19, not COVID - 1, folks!"
She seemed to have taken “19 ” as a version number and was laughed at on the internet,“ Read a newspaper if you have no common sense! ”
3 - Year Old Hit When Playing on University Sports Ground, Reasonable to Sue After Compensation is Paid?

Hit on Sports Ground, Child Sues University After Compensation is Paid
Reported by, Zhao Yifan
When playing on sports ground of an university, 3 - year old Xiaowen was accidentally hit in the head by a softball thrown by Chen from the softball team.
After being compensated by Chen for the accident, Xiaowen ’s father, acting as Xiaowen ’s legal guardian, sued the university in court, demanding an apology for what happened on the sports ground and a total of 20,000 yuan for medical bills and emotional distress.
Recently, the People ’s Court of Haidian District in Beijing heard the case and believed the university fulfilled its obligation to provide appropriate safety assurance by setting up a protective barrier at the sports ground; in addition, Chen had already compensated for the accident, and therefore, the claims of the plaintiff were dismissed.
As Mr. Wen claims, he took Xiaowen to the sports ground of the university during summer vacation in 2019, and the softball team was training on the sports ground at the same time.
To avoid potential risks, Xiaowen and Mr. Wen and other parents and children were playing in a safety area designated by the softball team.
However, later when Chen, a member of the softball team, was throwing the ball, it slipped out of his hand, went over the protective barrier into the safety area, and hit Xiaowen in the back of her head.
Mr. Wen took Xiaowen to the hospital immediately, and she was diagnosed as having head trauma.
Mr. Wen believes the sports field facilities are not in line with safety regulations and the university failed to effectively manage the softball team and relevant facilities.
It was negligence of the university that led to the incident, which caused physical and mental distress for Xiaowen and her family, hence the university should take legal responsibility.
Against these accusations, the university argued that it has set up protective barrier around the sports field and posted management regulations and training notices informing people to keep a safe distance from the training field when entering the sports ground and to be aware of their personal safety, and because the plaintiff couldn’t prove the university “didn’t fulfill safety assurance obligations ”, the university refused to pay compensation.
After hearing the case, the court believed the venue where the incident took place is open to public for free, and though the university bears safety assurance obligations for the sports ground, the extent of its obligations were merely to have general notices.
When the incident took place, there was a protective barrier set up by the university on the sports ground, meaning the appropriate safety assurance obligations were fulfilled, and Chen paid over 2,000 yuan in compensation for Xiaowen ’s medical bill, transportation, and other losses according to the compensation agreement reached, so the two parities agreed to settle their dispute once and for all.
Afterwards, Xiaowen ’s parents ’ claims for compensation from the university was found to be groundless, and the court ruled to dismiss all claims of the plaintiff.
After neither party decided to appeal, the verdict became effective.
According to Article 37 of Tort Liability Law, as the manager of a public place, the university bears safety assurance obligations; and when actions of a third party cause damages to others, the third party takes tort liability, while manager of the public place that fails to fulfill safety assurance obligations takes complementary liabilities.
The judge stated that because manager of the public place is the party most likely to know the actual state of the site, and to foresee potential dangers and harms, it is the most likely party to take necessary measures to prevent losses from happening or reduce damages and to keep the cost of damage prevention or reduction to a minimum, meaning the law requires it to bear the appropriate safety assurance obligations when engaging in social activities.
In this case, for the non-specific group of people entering the sports ground open to public for free, the school ’s safety assurance obligation were in line with the social activities it was engaged in, specifically which were primarily to take basic safety measures and to inform people of hidden dangers.
In juridical practice, it ’s not advised to make safety assurance obligations too high or too strict for the managers of public places.
If the university has set up a protective barrier and fulfilled its duty to inform, the university is considered not at fault and does not bear legal responsibility.
Furthermore, as to third party tort, even if the manager of public places such as a university doesn’t fulfill its safety assurance obligations, its liability is complementary to damage compensation; according to the new Civil Code, the manager can claim compensation from the third party after assuming complementary liability.
Therefore, the victim must not expand the scope of the claim after receiving compensation from the directly liable party in this kind of accident.
With regular pandemic prevention and control, people are more enthusiastic about exercise and fitness.
As the restriction of inter-provincial tourism business has gradually slackened, the tourism market is also about to welcome a recovery.
Fujian Province has resumed its inter-provincial tourism business from July 21, and in the first weekend after opening, Xiamen, a popular tourist destination, saw a peak in passenger flow.
As a popular tourist destination city, many tourists arrived in Xiamen on the weekend.
It is estimated that the Xiamen Railway Station will see 3.7 million passengers in summer, while the passenger flow at the airport is dominated by students, tourists, and people visiting relatives.
The tourism market is recovering gradually, and in July, Xiamen Airport operated an average of 440 flights per day, and domestic flights have recovered to 80% of the pre-pandemic level.
Airlines have increased the air express lanes from Xiamen to Shanghai, Beijing, Kunming, Xi 'an and other major cities to seize the revived tourism market.
At present, a number of travel agencies in Xiamen have successively launched a batch of domestic cross-provincial travel products during summer vacations, and the group itinerary is mainly focused on outdoor attractions.
In response to peak passenger flow in summer in railway stations and airports, relevant organizations have deployed additional manpower in areas where people are likely to gather such as check-in counters and security check lanes, and Fujian has also optimized and upgraded the "Fujian health QR code", realized health data sharing and mutual recognition with 31 provinces, and promoted the orderly recovery of the tourism market.

Israel Strengthens Measures to Prevent Epidemic from Recurring-Ecns.cn

Israel strengthens measures to prevent epidemic from recurring
At the beginning of the epidemic outbreak, Israel's prevention and control measures were effective.
However, with the gradual lifting of the ban, the number of confirmed cases in Israel has recently increased significantly, and the Israeli government has taken several emergency measures to strengthen its epidemic prevention and control.
On February 28, the first case was confirmed in Israel and prompt measures were taken to close all entry and exit points, suspend non-essential industries, and urge all schools to take classes online; moreover, they restricted public transportation and non-essential social activities, sealed off cities with severe outbreaks, and combined military and police efforts to maintain effective control and prevention measures.
This series of measures quickly yielded positive results, and by mid-May, the daily number of confirmed cases in Israel dropped to the single digits.
As the outbreak was brought under control, the blockade was completely lifted and the number of new confirmed cases has gradually seen a recurrence since June.
In particular, in July, the spread of the epidemic has accelerated since the beginning of the month.
Recently, the number of new confirmed cases in Israel has been above 1,500 per day for eight days, and by the time of this report on July 25, the number of new confirmed cases reached 916.
As of July 25, there were 59,745 confirmed cases and 448 death cases in Israel.
In the face of this rapid recurrence, the Israeli government has taken several emergency measures to strengthen epidemic prevention and control.
On July 6, after the number of confirmed cases exceeded 30,000, the Israeli government closed gyms, swimming pools, bars, nightclubs and other public entertainment venues, and introduced a policy of limiting public transport to a maximum of 20 passengers per bus.
On July 17, the government announced a series of new restrictions, including a "city lockdown" on weekends, from 17: 00 every Friday to 5: 00 every Sunday.
During this period, people will be allowed to go out but the shops, shopping centers, barber shops, beauty salons, libraries, zoos, museums, exhibition halls, swimming pools and tourist attractions will be closed; however, places providing basic services such as supermarkets and pharmacies will remain open.
In the meantime, gatherings of more than 10 people will be banned around the clock every day, gyms, studios, and other places will be closed, and restaurants and cafes will be closed for dine-in food, with only takeaway services allowed.
As yet, the Israeli public is not fully aware of the seriousness of the epidemic and fails to cooperate with the government in fighting against it.
In spite of the epidemic ’s recurrence in Israel, many people have taken to the streets in protest at the government's control measures that affected the public economic interests.
On July 11, tens of thousands of people demonstrated in Tel Aviv, arguing that anti-epidemic policies were affecting the economy.
On the evening of the 21st, thousands of protesters gathered in front of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem to protest against the ban on dine-in food in restaurants and cafes and the lack of compensation.
In addition, many people did not comply with the rules to wear masks and maintain a safe social distance of two meters when going outdoors, and many people only wore masks on their chins or hung them on their wrists to avoid being fined by the police for not wearing them.
During the epidemic recurrence, schools have been the most affected places by the COVID - 19; according to a recent reporter ’s visit to a kindergarten, it was found that teachers and students did not wear masks as required by the government, nor did they keep a safe social distance of two meters, thus creating a potential risk for a large number of teachers and students to be exposed to the virus.
Professor Eli Waxman, a member of the expert advisory group of the National Security Council of Israel on combating the epidemic, believes that Israel is heading towards a "dangerous situation", adding that the measures currently being taken to prevent and control the epidemic are insufficient and that all leisure and entertainment activities and summer schools should be closed in order to control the further spread of the epidemic.
Waxman states that Israel lacks an overall plan to combat the epidemic and that the Knesset and all government departments should put aside their own interests and agree on a clear step to combat the epidemic, including clear restrictions in different sectors.
Tel Aviv, July 25 (Xinhua) - - Reporter in Tel Aviv, Wang Jiong
Wu Fengfang, a farmer in Guyuan City of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, couldn't turn down her husband Dai Tianfu, so they started off by car from their home and arrived the Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard 10 kilometers away.
Despite the fact that he has had difficulty walking over the past two years, the 77 - year-old Dai Tianfu still expects to "come here every now and then to have a good time".
This is an inconspicuous courtyard in the Yuanzhou District of Guyuan, but unlike other ordinary farmhouses, songs of melodious Shanxi opera are often heard from this one, as well as terrific shadow plays, embroidery works, traditional Shaanxi opera and Meihu plays.
The owner of the courtyard is called Liang Yun, who used to be a carpenter.
More than 10 years ago, he began to design and construct the cultural courtyard because of his passion for shadow plays and opera.
With the Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard, villagers' cultural life has become much richer.
Before this reporter walked into the Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard, the melody of Shanxi opera was already wafting through the air.
The person who performing the Shaanxi opera excerpts for the villagers is Bo Lixiang, a villager from a neighboring village.
She has had a passion for Shanxi opera since childhood, is now well known locally, and she has free time, she comes to the cultural courtyard to perform for the villagers.
Recently, she has also taken up live webcasting.
“It's a blessing to have a stage where more people can see my performance," she said.
On the stage, the performers sing well and follow the instrumental melody, and despite being amateurs, their enthusiasm is undiminished.
Just like the rustic nature of the farmhouse, besides the Shanxi opera, the Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard is full of "grassroots" art and intangible cultural heritage.
The courtyard also has a collection of over 300 items from different eras, including farming equipment, traditional and handmade sculptures, paper-cutting, embroidery and shadow puppets.
Liang Yun leads the reporter into the exhibition hall, which displays his collection of old objects, such as old wine pots, Sanxianzi (stringed instruments), and spindle wheels.
Why did an ordinary farmer build a cultural courtyard?
"Shadow puppetry is my family's craft passed down from a long time ago, and I have been learning this since I was 15 years old..
The Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard was established in 2012 and became the first rural "Intangible Cultural Heritage Exhibition Hall" in Ningxia, as well as a demonstration courtyard for protecting intangible cultural heritage in Guyuan.
In addition to the Liang Yun Cultural Courtyard, more than 120 cultural courtyards have appeared in Yuanzhou District of Guyuan City, as well as 79 folk performance groups, of which there are more than 50 cultural courtyards of a certain scale, such as Shenjiahe Cultural Courtyard, Wang Yonghong Cultural Courtyard, and Yang Lang Cultural Courtyard, which are dispersed all over towns and streets in the Yuanzhou District, with more than 5,000 performers.
These grassroots artists are active in their fields, enriching the cultural life of the masses and satisfying the public ’s cultural needs.
"As life gets better and better, traditional culture can't just be utterly forgotten..
“Liu ’s Spy TV Series ” Returns with The Possibility of Victory with Performances from Liu Yunlong and Li Liqun - Xinhua Net
The 40 - episode spy TV series The Possibility of Victory will be broadcast on Beijing TV on July 16.
The Possibility of Victory is adapted from real historical facts, which was based on military archives of the Soviet Union which have been sealed for many years and revealed to the public for the first time.
Liu Yunlong, an actor well-known for his spy TV series, has made a breakthrough new work of art, acting as a “stuttering service agent ” who is comical, which is soon to be broadcast.
In recent years, the popularity of TV series including Pretender, Mask, and Kite proves the great appeal of spy TV series.
Different from previous spy TV series, The Possibility of Victory takes a global view, extending its context to Far Eastern battlefield in the Soviet Union.
It is based in the final stage of the Resistance War against the Japanese invasion in 1944, and tells the story about Tang Fei (played by Liu Yunlong), a secret agent of the Communist Party of China, who, led by Communist Party ’s President of Linhe Province and Director of Far Eastern Information Bureau of Soviet Union, executes the Soviet Union ’s “Mudanura ” strategic plan.
In many spy TV series, the heroes are all impeccably handsome and mature super spies with superb IQ ’s when they first appear on screen.
But in the opinion of Liu Yunlong, such people are not suitable to be spies, “Spies should be someone who won’t be recognized in the mass, and if he or she appears cool or handsome at first glance, he or she will attract nearly all the attention, so how can he or she hide in the enemy ’s camp? There is a line in Kite,“ If you hadn’t caught me, I would have nearly forgetten my identity as a member of Nationalist Party of China ”, which shows how spies should not be presented as elites. ”
Therefore, in The Possibility of Victory, Liu Yunlong ’s original idea was to design the hero Tang Fei as a comical “stuttering secret agent ”.
The “enemy ” camp in The Possibility of Victory, is led by the Japanese Fukuwara, played by Liang Guanhua, and Director of the Police Fang Shibao, played by Li Liqun.
These two skilled actors, one of whom comes from Northern China and the other from Southern China, invigorate multiple wonderful scenes in the TV series.
The director Yin Fei describes the performance of Li Liqun and Liu Yunlong as “an acting battle ”,“ It was definitely a battle, they coordinated very well with each other, which was very moving for me. At many times, their performance was “improvised ”, for instance, the script was only half a page, but without my disruption, they would continue their performance. ”
Masters don’t steal the show from others, and directors never disrupt a performance; all the actors were immersed in the characters, allowing them to not only craft the roles from the perspective of their characters, but also create more possibilities for the audience, and Yin Fei praised such performances as marvelous.
In the TV series, many familiar faces from “Liu ’s spy TV series ” can also be seen; for instance, three actors from the popular and influential“ Mountain Town F4 ” in Kite have roles in The Possibility of Victory.
Hou Yu and Liu Mingyang, who play Song Xiao ’ an and Zhao Jianzhi respectively, serve as Tang Fei ’s core assistants again.
Director Yin Fei said, “They don’t have any deep-rooted bad habits, they just followed the mainstream in that era, and that environment. ”
Liu Yunlong also said, “We should care about humanity. ” This means that there must be good and bad people, and the villains are enemies, but they should be presented well, and the good guys should also be presented properly. ”
The endings of the two characters were also carefully designed by Liu Yunlong, who believes that they will satisfy the audience.

The Lancet Article Praise China ’s Pandemic Efforts and Encourages Countries to Learn from Its Experience-ChinaNews.com
The Lancet published an article on the 25th, saying that China, as a country with 1.4 billion population and the size similar to Europe or the U.S., has effectively contained COVID - 19 outbreak at this stage, with no mass transmission again, and that it has the domestic pandemic under control to a great extent.
As the article mentioned, China ’s large investment in domestic research and public health reinforcement over the past decade made China much more prepared for COVID - 19 than it was for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
The author wrote, when SARS broke out in 2002, China wasn’t prepared at the beginning, especially since it wasn’t able to identify the pathogen.
When coronavirus was discovered in December 2019, Chinese scientists quickly identified the species of the virus and shared the genome sequencing data with the international community on January 11, 2020.
By the end of January, doctors from Mainland China and Hong Kong knew the clinical characteristics of the virus and published research papers in The Lancet to warn the world about the threat of the coronavirus.
China is also on the frontline of vaccine research, and when the national emergency state was announced, vaccine research was conducted swiftly and rigorously through close domestic collaborations; in May and July, early trial results of COVID - 19 vaccines developed by China were published in The Lancet.
China ’s experience shows the importance of investment in national health and research systems to effectively improve laboratory capabilities.
It ’s the foundation of a nation ’s fast and effective response to health emergencies and global health safety issues.
It ’s a lesson worth learning for other countries, especially low and middle income countries.
Aside from strong research capabilities, China ’s experience proves that strong leadership is necessary to make right decisions based on science, and was key to the effective control of COVID - 19.
The article underlines the fact that a government and its leaders must respect science and understand the value of science, so as to take actions most beneficial to society.
At the beginning of the outbreak, National Health Commission of China sent three groups of infectious disease experts to Wuhan to investigate risks and transmission of the coronavirus, whose suggestions informed the decision to “lock down ” Wuhan on January 23, and when some experts presented the necessity and urgency to build mobile cabin hospitals, the government quickly made the decision and implemented their advice while also seeking broad engagement with communities and the people, which contributed to the fast and effective control over the outbreak.
In the end, the article emphasizes, when facing global health emergencies, countries should strengthen global collaboration to jointly combat challenges.

The Reunions Directed by Da Peng Nominated by SIFF for Golden Goblet Awards - Xinhua Net
On July 18, 2020, the 23rd Shanghai International Film Festival announced the official nominated films for Golden Goblet Awards.
The first realistic film, The Reunions, directed by Da Peng, was nominated for the 23rd SIFF Golden Goblet Awards, and at the same time published its first poster.
Poster provided by producer
The Reunions is Da Peng ’s first realistic film, and is his second brush with the Golden Goblet Awards.
It tells the story of a comedy director who has a sudden inspiration to return her hometown village in Northeast China and make an art movie about famiiy reunions during Spring Festival, but who encounters a series of accidents.
The family members finally together for the film and have their final reunion.
On the film poster published today, a member of the family, “Third Uncle ” Wang Jixiang, sits in the center with a cigarette, and in the background is the black land of Northeast China covered by white snow, while the foreground is red lanterns hung for festivals.
The red lanterns symbolizing festivity and reunion contrast sharply with the lonely Wang Jixiang, and seem to show the complexity of large families.
According to reports, in the film, apart from the daughter of the “third uncle ” Wang Jixiang, played by Liu Lu, all other characters were played by the directors ’ family themselves, and this experimental audiovisual style breaks down the border between drama and reality, bringing about a brand new immersive experience for the audience.
According to Da Peng, inspiration came from “accidents ”, a series of family accidents during production, which changed the original production plan; the use of real-life performances without scripts was finally recorded as a film, creating a film far different from what he originally imagined.
How did Da Peng face these “accidents ”, and how did he embrace the changes brought about by the“ accidents ”?
There is no doubt that The Reunions is fully experimental: none of the cast are professionally trained, and the audiovisual style is quite creative, which transforms life into a movie, and composed of real-life videos, the audience will certainly find someone like themselves and their family, so that at the end of the film, it inspires deep thoughts.

Platoon leader Yu Wang and a soldier stand guard at the Banong Zhuokang Sentinel Post.
In this place where the average temperature annually is more than ten degrees below zero, a row of simply-decorated barracks stands at the pass, with a national flag flying in the wind not far from the barracks; soldiers here are on duty every day in the wind, while regularly patrolling to higher-altitude locations.
The soldiers climb up steep and rocky slopes on their hands and feet.
In late July, when lower altitudes are covered with flowers and leafy plants, only the ravine behind the barracks is relatively dense with greenery in Banong Zhuokang.
Gao Peng, a soldier who has been stationed at the post for six years, pointed to the ravine and said that it was their back garden, and that only in July and August every year can they see the grass growing slowly, and shortly afterwards it all turns yellow and is covered with snow.
A single foot patrol can take around nine hours.
In the tough plateau environment, the soldiers stationed here are constantly in the company of snow-capped mountains and glaciers, and they need to patrol passes on foot at high altitudes regularly.
Now, a patrol team of eight soldiers, led by instructor Liang Yixin, takes to the patrol route once again.
Each soldier carries a weight of about 30 jin, and heads for the destination early in the morning.
On the way, one soldier suffers from altitude sickness and is helped by his partners.
In addition to patrol duty, soldiers at the Banong Zhuokang Sentinel Post also need to conduct tactical and physical training on a daily basis.
The oxygen level gets lower and lower as time passes and the altitude rises, and these factors test the will of patrol members whose physical strength has been constantly overexerted.
Yet they grit their teeth and persevered in crossing several landslides and challenging rapids.
At around 16: 00, it was lunchtime for the patrol, and they sat down on the ground at an altitude of more than 5,700 meters, regardless of rain and snow, to replenish their strength with solid food for lunch.
The soldiers at the Banong Zhuokang Sentinel Post need to conduct tactical and physical training on a daily basis.
During breaks, they play cards together, and the loser is required to do push-ups, which is both entertaining and good for body building.
After a short break in the cold wind, they climbed up to the destination of this patrol, and when they arrived, they took out the national flag on the mountain pass and swore a solemn oath.
Behind them are the snow-capped mountains, and in front of them was a no-man's land stretching for dozens of kilometers, but they are the trustworthy guardians of this national gate.

In terms of exports, he believes that Hong Kong ’s situation abroad remains dire.

“Chinese Doctors ” pays tribute in film to heroes of the fight against the epidemic - Xinhuanet
Recently, representing the respects of Chinese filmmakers for the heroes of the fight against the epidemic, Bona Pictures board chairman Yu Dong and film director Liu Weiqiang (left in image) held a discussion and exchange symposium with academician Zhong Nanshan on the filming and production work for “Chinese Doctors ”, a film about the fight against the epidemic.
Bona Pictures hopes, through “Chinese Doctors ”, to pay tribute to all medical staff and epidemic control workers fighting on the front line in the fight against the epidemic!
In 2021, the film will be showed nationwide as part of the celebrations surrounding the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.
Currently, under the arrangement and direction of the Publicity Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the China Film Administration, and with the support of the Guangdong Province Film Administration and Hubei Province Film Administration, Bona Pictures is organizing the original crew of “The Captain ” to film“ Chinese Doctors ”, a film that will reflect the unified effort of the whole nation to fight the COVID - 19 epidemic under the firm leadership of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
The film will focus on the front line of the fight against the epidemic in Wuhan, feature Wuhan medical personnel and the medical aid teams from the various provinces as characters, and from the perspective of different personalities, use unique narratives and highly impactful cinematic language to provide a panoramic view of the moving story of the deep spirit of dedication and sacrifice among China ’s medical personnel in the fight against the epidemic.
It is reported that from the first moment of the day Wuhan was placed under lockdown, Bona Pictures overcame numerous obstacles to dispatch filming teams to the front lines of the fight against the epidemic, where they conducted face-to - face exchanges and footage collection with hundreds of medical workers, as well as interviews with Zhong Nanshan, the first rescue worker to arrive in Wuhan from Guangzhou, the medical aid team dispatched to Hubei from Guangdong, and the angels in white lab coats who formed the vanguard of the battle against the epidemic from institutions including Wuhan Jinyitan Hospital, Wuhan Union Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, and the Central Hospital of Wuhan, ultimately obtaining large amounts of precious first-hand footage.
At the symposium, academician Zhong Nanshan also expressed his hopes and expectations for the film, “I look forward to it, and I hope that while you feature some of the more publicly known experts, the majority of your interviews should focus on the medical workers who worked so diligently on the front lines.“
He stated that he had previously seen “My People, My Country ” and“ The Captain ”, and thought that telling the larger story from the perspective of ordinary people was a good technique.
“Some of our foreign friends still have some misunderstandings about China.“
Discussing the film ’s distribution, academician Zhong Nanshan said that currently, some people in foreign countries say the virus is a politicized topic, so he hopes the humanity of the film ’s perspective will move the audience, “Beyond just being screened in China, it ’s best if the film can also be screened abroad, so the film should be shot in a manner that allows both foreign and domestic audiences to understand and genuinely be moved.“
He fondly recalls the 1980 ’s film “At Middle Age ”, saying,“ After so many years, the opening up and reform-era film that made the deepest impression on me is still ‘ At Middle Age’, which moved my foreign doctor friends to tears, so it would be wonderful if ‘ Chinese Doctors ’ could have the same effect. “
Academician Zhong Nanshan said that if “Chinese Doctors ” resonates with foreign audiences, it will be a great success.
He also shared his opinions and advice on China ’s current epidemic control work, saying, “I ’m sure people will always be smarter than viruses.“
Zhong Nanshan said that although the virus is unpredictable, since primal times, humanity has overcome countless dangers, and with the advanced medical technology and social management measures we have in modern times, as well as the help of the global medical community and the universal basic awareness of scientific measures for combatting COVID - 19 among the general population, humanity will no longer be as helpless as before, “There are two things we have to focus on, the first being how to strengthen global cooperation, and the second how to provide emotional comfort and support for people.

There were also 141 new confirmed cases in Osaka Prefecture, 90 in Fukuoka Prefecture, and 80 in Aichi Prefecture.
Telecommunication fraud crimes increase by 70% in the first half of the year, the Supreme People's Procuratorate summarizes features - China News
July 26 (China News) According to the website of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in the first half of this year, the procuratorial organs across the country prosecuted a total of 58,101 people for fraud crimes, a year-on - year increase of 35%.
Especially among crimes obstructing the pandemic prevention and control, there are many fraudulent crimes, accounting for 43.4% of the total number of crimes obstructing pandemic prevention and control.
The Supreme People's Procuratorate has provided targeted guidance and has now released ten batches of typical cases involving pandemic prevention and control, including a total of 9 cases of fraudulent crime.
From the cases handled by the procuratorial organs in the first half of the year, a wide range of fraudulent crimes are involved, ranging from national macro policies to people's basic necessities of life: typical cases include pandemic-related fraud, "hospital scalping ”," health care products "," enrollment agencies "," loan fraud ", defrauding people of state subsidies, fraud regarding unfreezing national assets, and so on, but the new emerges out of the old constantly, and fraud involving education, medical care, employment, pensions, social security, land acquisition and relocation, targeted poverty alleviation, financial credit, and other areas has emerged, which has not only caused economic losses to the victims, but also seriously affected economic and social development.
In particular, some telecommunication fraud even crosses national boundaries or geographical and personnel restrictions, which involves victims without specific features and cause harm through cross-border, remote, and electronic payment.
For example, some set up companies in rented high-grade office buildings, providing multiple departments or positions that use legitimate online platforms for promotion, and which recruits, trains, and assesses its employees; management models of enterprise operation, cloaked in "legality", makes it even more confusing.
It is the compelling duty of the procuratorial organs to punish and prevent crime in accordance with the law, and to issue timely warnings to the public and relevant authorities.
In the judicial handling of cases, the procuratorial organs have conscientiously discharged their duties, maintained a high-handed attitude towards fraudulent crimes, and refined various law enforcement initiatives in a targeted manner to promote social governance by formulating and issuing procuratorial recommendations.
It is required for the procuratorial organs to strictly adhere to the facts, evidence, procedures, and application of the law in arresting and prosecuting swindlers; facts should be used as the basis and the law should be used as the criterion to ensure that no law is broken and no crimes can escape legal sanction.
In particular, for telecommunications fraud crimes, the central role of electronic data in the determination of facts is emphasized, and efforts should be made to build a chain of evidence that corroborates electronic data, verbal evidence, and documentary evidence.
For example, in pandemic-related fraud crime cases accepted by the Yinzhou District Procuratorate in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, the procuratorial organ intervened in advance and the whole process from the case occurrence to the conclusion only took five days, reflecting the attitude and determination to deal with the case quickly and strictly, and to maintain social stability.
In the review of arrests and prosecution, emphasis is placed on the prosecution of loophole crimes; until now, 733 people who were omitted from arrest and 1,113 accomplices who failed to be prosecuted previously by the public security have been taken in.
In the first half of the year, the procuratorial organs in China issued 298 procuratorial recommendations for fraud crimes to jointly prevent fraud crimes and promote deep-rooted governance.
For example, in response to the loopholes found in the telecommunications network supervision of communications enterprises, banks and intermediary organizations during the handling of cases as well as the Guangzhou Procuratorate and Dongguan Procuratorate in Guangdong Province made timely procuratorial recommendations that urged the relevant units to strengthen supervision, improve mechanisms, and help promote the construction of a long-term system.
Efforts were made to make criminals give up their takings and retrieve losses.
Procuratorial organs everywhere seized the opportunity to intervene in important links such as investigation, guided obtainment of evidence, review and prosecution, and urged the investigative organizations to actively recover illicit money together with relevant departments, meaning these departments can do a good job in recovering the illicit money and retrieving losses, and can strive to minimize the economic losses caused to the victims of fraudulent crimes.
For example, the People ’s Procuratorate of Beijing Municipality handled a loan crime case involving Lin, which involved 22 properties waiting to be sealed, and in the event that the properties might be disposed of by other cases beforehand, the first "Letter of Execution Suspension" was issued and sent to the relevant court in time, suggesting that the previous court executing the sealing order should put a hold on the handling of the properties involved, which will be disposed in a unified manner after the facts of the crime are ascertained, suggesting that all efforts have been made to recover the properties and retrieve the losses of the victims.
The prosecutor reminded to the public to be very alert regarding fraud crimes, to not expect "windfalls", to not readily believe others because the product is cheap, and to guard their own "wallets".
Yina Township in Weining County, Guizhou Province: Shorter Apple Trees, Wider Poverty-Alleviation Paths-ChinaNews.com
2020 - 07 - 26 11: 42: 58 Source: www.ce.cn Author: Zhu Yanjing Editor: Zhu Yanjing
In the summer heat, reporters from Economic Daily-ce.cn visited Zhonghai Village in Yina Township, Weining County, Guizhou Province.
Under the blazing sun, villager Li Yuanzhong hoed in the field, and though his face burning red, he was humming a happy tune.
Thanks to its low latitude, high altitude, abundant sunlight and big day-night temperature differences, the apples produced in Weining County have high sugar content and great taste, which have given them a certain notoriety in certain areas, yet the apples don’t sell for a good price because they are small in size and spotty, which is hwy they haven’t moved beyond this region.
Yina Township used to suffer from poverty, “getting through the year with corn and potatoes ”, and 10 years ago, the local poverty rate was 25.8%.
At this critical period of poverty alleviation, it is high time to change traditional growing practices and adjust the industrial structure to increase income for farmers.
After multiple visits and interviews, Chen Chao, secretary of the Party committee of Yina Township, along with the township team believe industry development can’t follow the old path.
Therefore, Yina Township brought in leading enterprises to grow apples in a modernized way.
In 2015, Hou Jianwen, Vice GM of Weining Chaoyue Agricultural Co. Ltd, came to survey Yina Township from Shaanxi and liked the local growing conditions instantly, so he started growing apple trees locally in 2016.
At first, the village called on Li Yuanzhong to convert his land to grow apple trees, but the Lis thought to themselves, “We ’ve been growing apples for years and nobody in this village got rich from it.“
“All the apples come from dwarf apple trees, the trees don’t grow too tall.“
What Li Yuanzhong didn’t expect was, new methods were be adopted to grow apples this time; irrigation pipelines were laid under each apple tree, so that water and fertilizer could reach directly to the roots; when harvesting apples in the fall, tractors could drive directly into the orchard and the apples could be reached from standing on ground.
At present, the apple base is seeing high yield in produce, and as Hou Jianwen expected, the apples are selling well, especially among consumers in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other cities.
As the apple industry expands, it brings new changes to Li Yuanzhong ’s life, and though he still farms, he has new sources of income.
As Li Yuanzhong transferred over 9 mu of his land to the apple base, he can collect land transfer fees each year, he also receives dividends from the apples, and he and his wife work on the base, “80 yuan per day each, with work year round. ”
Li Yuanzhong told the reporter he receives 2,800 yuan in dividends, and with the land transfer fees and work payments, his household annual income is over 80,000 yuan, “We ’re better off and don’t need to worry about survival anymore. ”
“We have achieved initial success, and our annual output value per mu of apple is over 15,000 yuan, which is 10 times that of corn.“
Chen Chao told the reporters, there are 20,000 mu of apples planted in Yina Township, with 6,000 mu in Zhonghai Village, covering 4,056 households and 17,200 people, among which are 2,952 people from 656 recorded poverty households; the over 6 million yuan a year issued as wages is a realization of not traveling far for work with the base at the doorstep.
With more income, Li Yuanzhong has started to realize his personal dreams.
During this Spring Festival, Li Yuanzhong bought a off-road vehicle, and now he drives to work, “We still have a dozen of mu of land, so when the apple base expands, I ’ll transfer it all to them, so we ’ll have even more income.“

Membrane Separation Technology Helps Resolve “Greenhouse Effect ” - ChinaNews. com
Membrane Separation Technology Helps Resolve “Greenhouse Effect ”
Illustration of New Mixed Matrix Membrane Fabrication Technology
Reported by Shang Rui: A few days ago, the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University made major progress in “capturing carbon dioxide with the membrane separation method ”, meaning they have successfully developed a new mixed matrix membrane fabrication technology which greatly improves the membrane material ’s performance in capturing carbon dioxide.
The relevant research findings are published as the cover story by Greenhouse Gases: Science and Technology, an international periodical.
The greenhouse effect is a major environmental problem standing in the way of human development, while carbon dioxide is the prime culprit for the greenhouse effect.
How to effectively capture and utilize carbon dioxide emissions from human activities is the focus of attention for scientists.
The membrane separation method is a new carbon dioxide capture technology which separates carbon dioxide gas with the help of the membrane material, and it is energy-efficient and easy to use.
How to make the membrane material “take deep breathes ” and improve gas separation efficiency was the hurdle of capturing carbon dioxide with the membrane separation method.
The Tianjin University research team investigated the impact of different solvents on the membrane ’s performance in gas separation through innovative thinking and repeated experiments.
According to experiment results, if N-Methyl pyrrolidone is used as the fabrication solvent, the distribution of carbon nanotube in the membrane material produced is more even, making it more breathable, which effectively improves the membrane material ’s gas separation performance and speed.
Fabricated with this new technology, the carbon dioxide separation performance of this mixed matrix membrane is close to the theoretical upper limit of this kind of membrane material.
“New technology has provided a new idea for capturing carbon dioxide using the membrane separation method.“
said Li Run, a team member of the atmospheric environment and bioenergy team of Tianjin University, “We hope this technology can provide support for exhaust gas treatment of coal-fired power plants and chemical enterprises in the future, because it can play a big role in fields such as greenhouse gas emission control.“
Understanding university major point deductions before choosing your preferred majors - Chinanews.com

Understanding university major point deductions before choosing your preferred majors
Each year, when we fill out our preferred majors on the NCEE (National College Entrance Examination), there are always students and parents who don’t understand the terminology involved, which can directly affect how you select your preferred majors.
This year, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Forestry University, and Beijing University of Chemical Technology issued a joint admissions policy for 2020 which eliminates major point deductions.
What are “major point deductions ”, and how do they impact your choice of major?
The three methods of major allocation
Experts say that before filling out your preferred majors, you should carefully read the school ’s “Admissions Guidelines ” to learn about the college ’s admissions regulations, including enrollment ratios, major allocation, and so on.
Major allocation refers to the three primary methods of admitting students to particular majors, which are major priority, score priority, and major point deductions, after a student enrolls at a university.
The specific method used by a particular university will be stated clearly in the “Admissions Guidelines ”.
However, some universities use balanced prioritization, and do not apply point deductions for different majors.
This means that all students who qualify for enrollment are ordered by a balanced total score, and if their score falls below enrollment requirements for their first preferred major, the university looks at whether the student qualifies for the second preferred major, and so on until the student ’s final preferred major, none of which involves point deductions for any major.
“Major point deductions ”, as they are called, are when universities apply one or several values calculated through a formula published in the“ Admission Guidelines ” to determine a student ’s admission in a particular selected major; this value is called a “major point deductions ”.
This refers to the point deduction that occurs between the student ’s preferred major and another major, expressed by a point value, such as 3 points, 2 points, or 1 point.
Consider this example:
Xiaoming, a student, applies to University A with an NCEE score of 560 and major preferences listed in this order: Computing, International Trade, Automation, Mechanical Engineering, and E-commerce, after which University A applies major point deductions of 2, 1, 1, and 0 points.
When allocating majors, if Xiaoming meets the admission requirements for his first preferred major of Computing and the major has remaining vacancies, he is admitted to the Computing major; if he is not admitted to the Computing major, he is considered for his second preferred major of International Trade with 2 points deducted from his NCEE score, at 558, and his qualifications are considered for that major; if he again fails to qualify, 1 point is deducted (for a total of 557), and he is considered for his third preferred major; if he further fails to qualify, 1 more point is deducted (for a total of 556), and his qualifications are considered for his fourth preferred major, and if he fails to qualify this time, no points are deducted when he is considered for his fifth preferred major, and so on.
Different universities have different point deductions
As balanced major preferences become more popular, many universities have already stopped using major point deductions, but some universities still use this method, and from the “Admissions Guidelines ” published by each school, we know that this year, major point deductions are applied at over 20 universities.
These include Sichuan Agricultural University, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu University of Science and Technology, Jiangxi Normal University, Chengdu Medical College, Northeast Electric Power University, Jimei University, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing Tech University, Ningxia University, Shandong University of Technology, and Civil Aviation Flight University of China.
The major point deduction values applied at each of these universities are different.
Some apply the same point deductions to every major, such as Ningxia University, where an applicant can expect to find 1 point deducted for each major in the order of major preference.
Other universities use different fixed point values for different universities.
Jimei University, for example, applies a total deduction of 4 points, meaning there is a difference of 3 points between a student ’s first preferred major and other preferred majors, among preferred majors after the first there is no further deduction by preference (meaning they receive equal deductions), and there is a 1 point difference between preferred majors after the first and non-preferred majors.
When reporting major preferences, students and parents must be sure to carefully read the university ’s admissions policies to see if there are major point deductions, and while considering the point values, must also carefully consider their universities and majors of choice; if the university lists clear major point deductions in the Admission Guidelines, they should pay close attention to the point tiers of different majors so they can maximize their chances of admission.

Crowds Gather in Chengdu to See the US Consulate, and the Police Stop People from 'Looking too Happy'
China on Friday announced the shutdown of the US Consulate General in Chengdu in response to the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston.
On Saturday, the badge of the U.S. Consulate was removed, and on Sunday, a dark-glass car drove away amid boos from passers-by.
On Sunday, many people in Chengdu gathered in front of the U.S. Consulate to take photos, and even those who had never visited the consulate came to have a look, motivated by curiosity about current events.
AFP's Chengdu reporter also visited the US consulate in Chengdu and reported that curious people were coming in droves, as well as many parents with their children walking to see the consulate and taking pictures of the building or taking selfies.
Guards swarmed around the consulate, and the police occasionally “corrected ” people's behavior, seeming not to allow any transgressions: a woman was stopped just as she started singing a revolutionary song, and a guard confiscated a banner.
But residents of a nearby residential building managed to hang a giant Chinese flag on the balcony and shout pro-China slogans.
The U.S. Consulate in Chengdu opened in 1985, and covered all U.S. consular affairs in Southwest China, especially in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
AFP's Chengdu reporter said that the Chinese government's response to the US was relatively restrained: many Chinese people asked the government to close the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong on the Internet, but officials only said that "the shutdown of the US Consulate in Chengdu is a necessary and legal response to the unreasonable behavior of the United States."
At present, in addition to Chengdu, the United States also has consulates in Guangdong, Shanghai, Shenyang, Wuhan, and Hong Kong.
Large-Scale Media Convergence Campaign "Watch Poverty Alleviation Livecast from Villages" Launches - Today's News - Hunan Daily Website - www.voc.com.cn
Hunan Daily · New Hunan Client Terminal, July 25 (reporter from this organization) On July 25, two caravans carrying 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system slowly drove out of Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province for the large-scale media convergence campaign "Watch Poverty Alleviation Livecast from Villages" sponsored by the China Media Group ’s Financial Program Center.
General secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that "2020 is a year of milestone significance, because we will finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and realize the first centenary goal; 2020 is also a year of decisive victory for the elimination of poverty. ”
The large-scale media convergence campaign "Watch Poverty Alleviation Livecast from Villages" is an important measure taken by the China Media Group ’s Financial Program Center in coordination with this major theme and promote poverty alleviation.
The campaign will go into villages receiving poverty relief in more than 20 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government to discover fresh poverty relief stories, directly view the huge changes in the appearance of the villages, and show how the villagers have overcome the difficulties of survival and development and moved towards the road of prosperity.
The campaign will last more than three months.
Starting from Xuzhou, the reporter group divided and followed two routes: one is the southwest route, going through Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Tibet, and other places; the other is the northwest route, which goes through Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Hebei, and other places, covering a distance of more than 10 thousand kilometers.
In the format of its reports, "Watch Poverty Alleviation Livecast from Villages" uses a bold integrated style.
The economic development of the villages visited by the caravan will be broadcast on CCTV - 2 of the China Media Group, CNR Business Radio, CNR China Traffic Radio, and CCTV Financial New Media.
Among them, the live TV broadcast will be mainly completed during the noon news program "World Finance" on CCTV - 2 (airs 12: 00 - 13: 00 from Monday to Sunday), and the primetime news program "Economic News" on CCTV - 2 will air a special program on Poverty Alleviation (airs 20: 30 - 21: 30 from Monday to Sunday).
Meanwhile, the caravan will carry out a 1 - hour live broadcast of each village on the CCTV Finance App, where the audience can watch the live broadcast and participate in a lucky draw by downloading the CCTV Finance App.
In terms of technology application and studio design, "Watch Poverty Alleviation Livecast from Villages" makes a bold breakthrough, pioneering the "new media caravan in the field" model.
Each caravan is equipped with 5G new media mobile cloud production and broadcasting system, and uses 5G + 4K / 8K + AI technology to achieve the organic fusion of online and offline, large screen and small screen, and TV broadcasting.
They are equipped with a 3 - channel studio area made of retrofitted storage containers that are 12 meters long, 2.55 meters wide and 3.98 meters high, and which have automatic hydraulic expansion structure, and can be turned upwards up to 120 degrees.
The studio area can also be automatically expanded, and come with an external expansion platform of more than 50 square meters, which matches the scene requirements of most programs.
Summer is boiling hot in Kunming ’s Dongchuan District, but poverty alleviation workshops next to population relocation sites are heating up faster than the summer thermometer.
Lv Ling, Kunming Aisifu Electronics Technology Company employee, says, “Now, I walk right out of my house and right into the factory gate, I can earn money and take care of my family at the same time, and it ’s all thanks to the free vocational training arranged by the Trade Union.“
A bustling scene unfolds before your eyes as you walk into the electronics component processing poverty alleviation workshop on Tongdu Street in Dongchuan District.
Lu Ling, now in her 40 ’s, is a single mother who supports her child and her elderly parents by herself.
When things were at their most difficult for her, the Dongchuan District Federation of Trade Unions helped her find solutions and provided all kinds of aid that was like “a glass of water in the desert ”.
Since 2018, she has enjoyed housing, school, social insurance, and employment assistance from policies and assistance funding from trade unions at every level.
This year, her child graduated and found a job, and she herself found a job and gained an income after receiving vocational training, which finally helped her escape her difficult situation in late April.
According to reports, the Special Poverty Alleviation Vocational Skills Training Program organized by the Dongchuan District Party Committee is part of the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions skills training work.
Based on the unique characteristics of poverty alleviation for the recently relocated employment-challenged in the district, the District Committee has conducted in-depth investigations to understand training requirements and determine the types of vocational training to be conducted, and in the near future plans to train a total of 450 electricians, welders, and pastry chefs.
Li Yi, an employee at the Agricultural Bank ’s Yunnan Menglian County Branch, recently wrote a heartfelt letter of thanks to the County Federation of Trade Unions.
In her letter, she offered sincere thanks for the Golden Autumn Scholarship she received from the trade union from August 2013 to January 2017, which allowed her to complete her studies.
After Li Yi ’s father passed away in a car accident in 2004, her mother received employment-challenged status, and has enjoyed the benefits of inclusion in the system since.
With the help of the local trade union, Li Yi successfully completed her studies.
Since 2016, systemic guarantees and targeted assistance have lifted 3,809 households out of poverty.
The successful poverty relief offered to Lv Ling ’s family and Li Yi are a window into the poverty alleviation efforts for the employment-challenged of Yunnan ’s trade unions.
According to Duan Kaiyuan, who works at the Yunnan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions in the Legal and Rights Protection Work Department, the Federation ’s provincial headquarters has enhanced its dynamic management of the employment-challenged filing system, pushed normalize filing for assistance, and worked to actively bring those qualified for employment-challenged status into assistance systems; they have also expanded channels to apply for employment-challenged status by creating a WeChat application platform to make it easier for the employment-challenged to seek and apply for assistance on their own.
During the epidemic, seeking work outside the home has been difficult, so to help alleviate pressure on the livelihoods of the employment-challenged, the Yunnan Province Central Party Committee has arranged a total of 13 million yuan in “Delivering Comfort ” aid, providing 2,000 yuan to every household in the national employment-challenged database and 1,500 yuan to every household in the provincial employment-challenged database, aid that reached a total of 6,000 employment-challenged households nationally and 1,000 employment-challenged households in the province through the special program.
At the same time, the Yunnan Province Central Party Committee, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, zhaopin.com, and other online job recruitment sites worked together to push job recruitment information to the employment-challenged, provide employment consulting and guidance, and provide other services.
